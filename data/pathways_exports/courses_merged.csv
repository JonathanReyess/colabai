2,1,Create a Website: Structure (Intro to HTML),"<p>The web connects us like never before. It is thrilling to think that somewhere on the other side of the planet someone could be looking at the exact same website you are browsing, maybe at this exact minute even! We are a social species, and we, as a group, enjoy sharing ideas, information and more. We do so continuously and with an efficiency never matched before thanks to the web. In some regards, that is why you want to take this class, because you would like to create a website for the first time ever (or in forever), and you know it all starts with the structure. You can't put up drywall or a roof on a house without building the skeletal frame first. In this class, you will learn the basics of HTML, the content language of the web. We will explore HTML usage, its syntax and best practices when it comes to HTML file setups. We will also look into key features of HTML such as relationships between elements, the box model and specificities (classes, ids, attributes) which will be extremely important as we continue our journey. Finally we will put all that into practice by creating a web page using Codepen.io</p>Create a Website: Structure (Intro to HTML)","<p>Powerpoint:</p>

5,1,Intro to Procedural Modeling via Houdini,"<p>Houdini is a top choice in the world of Hollywood VFX (visual effects). When you see giant battle scenes, giant explosions you are probably seeing the output of Houdini. We are going to start from the basics though, in this introductory workshop and work on making some static procedural models. By making our models procedural, we can easily move a slider, and our model will ""rebuild"" itself based on the new parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong><br />David Zielinski |&nbsp;<em>Technology Specialist at OIT Co-Lab (VR/AR)</em><br />David has been at Duke for 17+ years, a large portion of that as the R&amp;D engineer for the Duke DiVE: a 6 sided virtual reality theater. Coming up originally through computer science, he has strong software development skills, and has developed numerous VR applications. In the past few years he has been working with Archeologists and Art Historians in the department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies to make projects for the current consumer headsets (Oculus Quest) and for phone/tablet AR (as featured in the Senses of Venice installation in the Duke Library last year). Most recently he has been exploring Social VR via the Altspace platform.&nbsp;</p>Intro to Procedural Modeling via Houdini",<ul></ul>,"---

106,1,Advanced CSS: Get to know Grid and Shape,"<p>If you've done some CSS before, you know how much of a pain it is to place things just so... You've tried all the tricks, you've done all the math, and yet you can never get your layout exactly the way you were envisioning on paper... or you could but you had to try a million combinations or write what felt like a million lines of code. You are a wizard and CSS is magic... let Grid become your wand of supple wood with a phoenix core, and harness that power! Grid allows you to place things horizontally, vertically anywhere and everywhere, however you like, whenever you like. Want to move your footer in the middle of the page when your screen is between 800px and 1200px wide without using javascript ? You can! Want to have everything divided into 12 exact columns without worrying about margins and paddings and making mad calculations? You can! Want a grid within a grid within a grid? You can! This class is for made for the CSS enthusiast, or the downright frustrated CSS user who just would like to kill floats with fire. Intermediate understanding of CSS is expected to follow this class comfortably. If you do not know CSS, or haven't worked with it in a while, we suggest taking our Create a Website: Styling and Create a Website: Layout classes beforehand.</p>

<p>While simple on its surface, CNC milling can be a nuanced topic to learn. Often, the best way to understand the topic is to simply get reps in on a machine. To help with that, the CoLab has added a fleet of mini-CNC-mills loaded with the same software that powers our larger machines. This is a &ldquo;get dirty&rdquo; class, students will spend a relatively small amount of time in lecture and most of the period making stuff!\</p>

<p>Central to 3D modeling is the concept of Solid Modeling, this design approach is how most mechanical products you are familiar with are created. In this workshop we will learn easy to use tools that will allow us to make infinitely configurable shapes easily manipulated into complex objects. This class is a good first stop in your journey to creating practical objects. In this course, we will explore tools powerful enough to create useable objects for 3D printing or other applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solid modeling products are core tools in the disciplines of mechanical engineering and manufacturing, but you don&rsquo;t have to be a mechanical engineer to use them. Many other disciplines will benefit from having the ability to create solid parts with the emerging accessibility of 3D printing and desktop machining. Learners will explore Onshape, an agile, platform agnostic cloud tool that can be quickly picked up. Solid modeling is a common foundational &ldquo;first stop&rdquo; on the path to more complex 3D modeling applications or methods. During the class, those in attendance can expect to discuss more about other disciplines and the tools they use as well as getting some advice about more advanced classes in the Digital Modeling &amp; Fabrication Roots Track. &nbsp;</p>

138,1,Singularity Containers,"<p>This workshop provides researchers in the humanities, arts, and sciences an opportunity to become familiar with containerization tools, which are in wide use in the research computing world. The workshop will introduce the tools and provide hands-on experience. Researchers with software they want to package -- or ""containerize"" -- for use on the cluster or elsewhere will be able to do so. We will introduce Gitlab-CI (<a href=""https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/"">https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/</a>) and Singularity (<a href=""https://sylabs.io"">https://sylabs.io</a>) and tools that OIT programmers have built to automate the production of ""cluster-ready"" Singularity containers. Who should take part? Users of the Duke Compute Cluster; researchers who are using software with specific and perhaps exotic library dependencies; researchers who are using computers at other locations, including XSEDE supercomputers, Open Science Grid (OSG), or computers shared with colleagues at other institutions, researchers who want to increase the likelihood that their computational methods are transportable and reproducible.

Foamsmithing doesn&rsquo;t require the heat of a forge, but heat guns will make the foam pliable. Contact cement will give us a weld stronger than steel (not really), and craft foam and foam clay will be perfect for any small details! Once you&rsquo;ve built a piece of foam armor, you&rsquo;ll be armed with all the knowledge you need to construct a convention-ready battle suit.</p>

192,1,Make Your Own Solar Lamp,"<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">The current threat posed by climate change calls for a profound rethinking of our use of technology and natural resources. Low Tech proposes a more sustainable, inclusive, and convivial approach to empower the individual to fight climate change and build a more desirable future for everybody. For instance, this approach aims at moving from a linear to a circular economy, where waste is reused and, ultimately, non-existent by design.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">In this workshop, we will focus on the example of electronics recycling and learn how to reuse some of our everyday electrical devices to keep them out of landfills. Namely, you will learn how to reuse your old laptop batteries to build a solar lamp/charger.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">The batteries will be provided in partnership with Triangle Ecycling, as well as the electronic components. That said, feel free to contact the organizers if you have an old laptop that you intend to recycle (modern batteries cannot be reused easily).</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">Apart from the electronic circuit, the design of the lamp will depend on the user. From a romantic interior design to a waterproof outdoor design, this is the occasion to reuse an old plastic or wooden box for instance (think lantern or Moroccan lamps e.g.). While the esthetics of the lamp won&rsquo;t be the focus of this 2-hour workshop, participants are encouraged to participate to a follow-up workshop, to make the most of Co-Lab&rsquo;s manufacturing tools.</span></p>Make Your Own Solar Lamp","<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">The Low Tech Lab (a French nonprofit) offers great resources: this workshop is based on their wiki below.

208,6,Introduction to Wheel Throwing ,"<p>Learn how to throw pottery on the wheel! In this introductory class, you will learn the basics of centering and throwing cylinders. This class is focused on gaining an introduction into throwing techniques rather than creating a finished product and is a prerequisite to using the Arts Annex pottery wheels during open studio hours.</p>
<p>This is a Zero-Waste Duke Arts Create class. Students will practice on the wheel and their clay will be recycled for the next class. Clay may be recycled indefinitely before it has been fired. Once clay is fired it lasts virtually forever and will not breakdown. Duke Arts Create supports ethical and sustainable artistic practices and therefore will not be firing work produced during this class.</p>
<p>After completing Duke Arts Create Introduction to Wheel Throwing, students may work in the Arts Annex clay studio during open studio hours or come to Duke Arts Create Intermediate Wheel Throwing to complete a work to fire and keep.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: This will be a 3-hour workshop beginning at 5:30PM. Space is limited to only 12 participants. Please only enroll if you are sure you can attend. If you must cancel, please do so well in advance so another person can take your place. We anticipate the waitlist for this workshop will exceed 100 people.</p>Introduction to Wheel Throwing ",,,,2023-02-02 16:02:53.101238,2023-02-01 04:05:43.478871,,2023-02-01 04:02:31.079152,2023-11-21 15:07:57.944835,,12,8,,Introduction-to-Wheel-Throwing-

255,7,Putting Reproducibility into Practice,"<p>Making research reproducible means following specific methods and using tools to ensure other people can easily replicate and verify the research. This involves keeping things organized and well-documented &mdash; like the code, data, and materials used in the research &mdash;and developing cohesive workflows to track changes, automate processes via script or code, and allow collaboration among researchers. To make research data easily accessible through archival repositories, it should be published and stored for others to find and reproduce. By sharing the research through trusted online platforms, the data becomes readily available for a long time; is assigned unique identifiers (DOIs); encourages citation and reuse; and demonstrates FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)</p>Putting Reproducibility into Practice",<p>Computer with internet access</p>,"<p class=""amber-el amber-paragraph amber-content"">By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>

278,6,POETRY IN MUSIC,"<p>Presented in Partnership with DukeCreate &amp; DuWell<br>Instructor: VaChikepe: The Poet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this workshop, students will be introduced to Leonard Dembo through his song, &ldquo;Munovenga Mudzimai Wangu&rdquo;, which translates to &ldquo;You Don't Like My Wife&rdquo;. According to The Herald, documenting the growth of music in Zimbabwe without mentioning Leonard Dembo would be incomplete. Dembo, who passed away on April 9, 1996, at the age of 37, was one of the greatest musicians to emerge from the country. His music addressed societal issues, including love, unity, and peace. Dembo is arguably the best musician to grace the Zimbabwean music scene. Listening to the depth of the above-mentioned song, I asked myself a question, &ldquo;Was Leonard Dembo a poet?&rdquo; Students will have the opportunity to listen to Dembo's song and extract abstract thoughts from it. They will also be provided with a translated version of the song and encouraged to create their own inspired written pieces. Students will then share their creations, and our guest poet will provide an interpretation of the song. This process aims to inspire students to discover poetry within music and all aspects of life, as a means to tap into the profound love that resides within us.</p>POETRY IN MUSIC",,,,,2023-09-21 22:16:06.029267,,2023-09-21 22:15:10.729437,2023-11-21 15:07:59.012233,,30,11,,POETRY-IN-MUSIC
