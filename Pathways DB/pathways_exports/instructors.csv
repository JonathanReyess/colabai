I teach in the English Department and the Information Science + Studies program. I am interested in the theory and ethics of the use of large scale databases in humanistic research and pedagogy. My theoretical framework is informed by Ludwing Wittgenstein, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Michael Polanyi as well as by Daniel Kahneman’s account of decision making and reasoning processes.

I am the faculty coordinator for the Rhodes Fellowship in the Computational Humanities, supported by the Rhodes Information Initiative at Duke.

I help to organize the humanities projects at Data+.",2023-10-23 22:43:07.075795,2023-10-23 22:45:30.622482
