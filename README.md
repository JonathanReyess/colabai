# Duke Innovation Co-Lab AI Project

This project aims to explore the various ways in which the emerging field of artificial intelligence can be leveraged and applied to Duke University's Innovation Co-Lab.

## 1 - Pathways Course Recommender

**Recommendation system being applied:** Content Based Filtering - usage of item features to recommend other items similar to what a user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback (per Google for Developers - Machine Learning).

### Steps

1. **Store Data in CSV Format:** 
   - Store our two datasets in .csv format, one with a list of all modules and their descriptions, another with a studentâ€™s module history.

2. **Read and Prepare Data:** 
   - Read our .csv data files with Pandas and store it in our data frames.
   - Clean our data frames by removing unnecessary data columns and take into account whether the student attended the class.

3. **Text Vectorization:** 
   - Perform text vectorization for the description of each module using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which converts our descriptions into a numerical matrix from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
   - Modify the following parameters when creating our TF-IDF matrix to control how TF-IDF values are calculated:

   ```markdown
   tfv = TfidfVectorizer(
       min_df=3,           # Ignore terms that appear in fewer than 3 descriptions
       max_features=None,  # Keep all unique terms
       strip_accents='unicode',
       analyzer='word',    # Treat words as the analytical unit
       token_pattern=r'\w{1,}',  # Consider words with at least 1 character
       ngram_range=(1, 3),      # Consider unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
       stop_words='english'     # Remove common English stop words
   )
