prompt: Does the List Meet a Legitimate Need?, completion:  Legitimate needs fall within the following scopes: Academic Business Professional or Social Event The mailing list should serve the goals of Duke organizations, departments, schools, events, or other entities of some sort. The mailing list can also be used for a nationally recognized organization whose membership includes Duke associates. EXAMPLES: Students can request a list for a particular Duke sponsored social event on or off campus. Students requesting a list for a particular Duke student group needs to be listed as the primary contact on the group roster per https://duke.collegiatelink.net/ Students cannot request a list to be used to email all their friends every Friday to find out where everyone is going that night. Students can use their email client address book group feature for that. Are You in Any Position of Authority at the Organization? Is the mailing list request proportional to your position in the organization? If you request RAdorm@duke.edu, are you an RA in that dorm?

prompt: Does the Requested List Name Reflect the List's Purpose of Use in Any Way?, completion:  The list name should either match the initials or be an abbreviation of the organization name, or describe the event or usage of the list. A faculty member sponsoring an annual craft fair on campus could request something along the lines of craftfair@duke.edu. For one-time events (non-recurring), please consider something more like craftfair2008@duke.edu to allow possible future craftfair events organized by other groups. The list name biology@duke.edu will be reserved for the Department of Biology istead of an individual who is running a biology club. The club can have other similar names, such as biology-club@duke.edu or biology-enthusiasts@duke.edu. Is the Requested List Name Already Taken? OIT Service Desk will check availability and inform the requester if it is in use and to request a new list. Global Health Institute cannot request ghi@duke.edu because that address is reserved for Gary Harold Isaksen. Try globalhealth@duke.edu or ghinstitute@duke.edu. Middle Ages History cannot request mah@duke.edu, mah08@duke.edu, or mah100@duke.edu. Try midage@duke.edu, middleages@duke.edu, or mahsociety@duke.edu.
prompt: What are the naming convention limitations/requirements?, completion:  The list's name; its address will be listname@duke.edu. The list name should be all lowercase, no longer than 40 characters, and should only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Lists with spaces, periods or other punctuation will be denied at time of creation or during the approval process.  Hyphens are recommended over underscores.
prompt: What is the turn-around time from request to approval?, completion:  The turn-around time from request to approval is <5 business days. I would like to change my list's name. How can I do that. There is a rename list option in your admin panel for the list.  Use this to have a request sent to the OIT Service Desk for proper protocol of the name change.  Sending an email to the Service Desk will result in a denial.

prompt: When connecting into an OIT lab machine I receive an unable to open a display error message, completion:  SSH Arguments and X11 forwarding Workaround/Fix
prompt: When attempting to run Matlab, gedit, SPSS or other various commands while connected to an OIT lab machine, please note that they will only function correctly if they are existent in that environment. The following is a fix for being able to successfully execute any of these commands only when applied to the correct environment or workstation:, completion:  In this example, we will use Matlab as the desired command to be executed. Open a Terminal under the Utilities. You will have a command line interface box appear. Type ssh -X Netid@login.oit.duke.edu, then press enter. You will then be prompted for a password. Enter your NetID password. You are now logged into the login.oit.duke.edu environment using your Netid as the Authentication method. From here you will simply type matlab and the Matlab application will launch in GUI. Some individuals have received an unable to open a display error. The workaround for this is as follows: In this example we will use Matlab as the desired command to be executed. Open a Terminal under the Utilities. A command line interface box will appear. We will first need to add the workstation to the Access Control List. To do this, we will need to type xhost + login.oit.duke.edu. This will add login.oit.duke.edu to the ACL. Once we have added login.oit.duke.edu to the ACL, we will need to execute the Y argument with ssh. To do so we will need to type ssh -X -Y Netid@login.oit.duke.edu. You will be prompted to enter a password. Enter your NetID password. A small banner will appear with a time stamp of when you logged in and from where you logged in. Extra Information to make note of concerning the -X and -Y argument directly from the main pages: -X Enables X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file. -Y Enables trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwarding are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.

prompt: How can I recover documents I did not save before Word froze or crashed on my Mac?, completion:  After Microsoft Word for Mac stops responding or after you use the Force Quit command to end a Word for Mac session, you may only recover some documents when you restart the program. Additionally, the documents that you recover do not contain the changes or additions that you made in your last Word for Mac session. To resolve this issue, try to open the AutoRecovery files that you saved during the session. By default, Word for Mac saves all the AutoRecovery files in the following folder location: Macintosh HD/Users/username/Documents/Microsoft User Data   To open the AutoRecovery files, follow these steps: Close Word for Mac. On the Go menu, click Home. Open the Documents folder, and then open the Microsoft User Data folder. Locate all the files that start with the words "AutoRecovery save of." For each file that matches this criteria, rename the file. Then, add the ".doc" file name extension. Note - when you do this, the icon changes to a Word document icon. If the icon does not change to a Word document icon, follow these steps: On the File menu, click Preferences. Click to select the Show all file extensions check box. Close the Advance box, and then repeat step 5. Double-click the file. The document now opens in Word for Mac. Note If the AutoRecovery files are not in the Microsoft User Data folder, you'll need to verify that the default location has not changed. To do this, follow these steps: Start Word for Mac. On the Word menu, click Preferences. Click File Locations. Note the folder location that is listed for AutoRecover files. Click OK. Then, quit Word. Repeat the steps that are listed at the start of this section. However, instead of performing steps 2 and 3, open the folder location that you noted in step 4 For further assistance please contact the OIT Service Desk: http://oit.duke.edu/help/index.php

Duke North After-Hours Security Screening Station Duke University Hospital is committed to supporting a safe environment. In partnership with Duke Police, facilities and safety teams continually assess opportunities to enhance safety within the facility and on the grounds. With this in mind, staff has worked with Duke Police in the establishment of a new, after-hours security screening station just inside the front doors of Duke North. Screening procedures are as follows: Security officers at this station will screen all individuals seeking to enter the facility between 9:00 P.M. and 5:30 A.M. Hospital staff members, as always, may continue to enter and exit through these doors but must display valid Duke IDs to enter the hospital. It is important to remember to wear your Duke ID badges to work per hospital policy. Visitors that arrive to see patients after 9:00 P.M. will be asked to proceed to the second visitor relations/security station in front of the visitor elevators. There, each visitor who is approved for entry will receive a visitor pass. Individuals who present to the front door screening station and cannot demonstrate a valid need to be in the hospital facility after normal operating hours will be denied entry. Security officers at the front door station will also monitor outside entry approaches and the Duke North traffic circle. Duke University Safety Manual (Applies to all Duke University and Duke Health facilities Duke University Hospital goals are to ensure the accessibility of the facility to all who have valid reasons to be onsite while also ensuring the safety of all patients, visitors, and team members. Other security enhancements being installed over the next several weeks include security swipe locks in the Duke North lobby stairwells and hallway doors in the Radiology/Emergency Department hallway. All other entry doors to Duke Hospital and Duke Clinic facilities have been fitted with electronic or conventional locks and will be locked after hours, and routine checks of these doors will be made nightly by hospital security officers. As always, security officers will patrol the hospital and clinic building at night, and individuals found in buildings without a valid Duke ID or visitor pass will be escorted off campus.

Eligibility and Process Students Students automatically get a NetID upon matriculation. At the start of each semester, OIT creates NetIDs and passwords for new undergraduate students and provides these to the Registrar. The Registrar provides undergraduates with their NetIDs and passwords in the registration packet. For graduate students, OIT sends the NetID and password information to the department. The department distributes them to the students. Faculty and Staff Faculty and staff are assigned NetIDs automatically when the new-hire iForm is completed in SAP (the HR system of record). This form should also be used when the new hire is being processed before the official start date. NOTE: OIT no longer prints or distributes NetID letters for new Duke employees to payroll representatives.
prompt: How can I find out if a NetID has been generated?, completion:  Visit Online@Duke > Directory Search. The most accurate way to search is to enter the new employee's Duke Unique ID in the search block. The person's directory entry will include the correct Duke Unique ID and NetID, both of which are considered public directory information.
prompt: What if I submitted the new-hire iForm but the NetID has not been generated?, completion:  This process may take up to two business days. If there is an urgency in obtaining the NetID, a department supervisor can send an email request to help@duke.edu including the new employee's Unique ID from the new-hire iForm submission. Where do they get the password? New faculty and staff can generate the NetID password when they visit the various DukeCard Offices (DUH, DRH, DHRH and CAMPUS) to get their photo IDs. Swiping the new photo ID at a DukeCard Express Station will initiate an online process for creating the NetID password. If they are unable to visit the DukeCard Office, faculty and staff may contact the appropriate IT Service Desk (below) for assistance in setting the NetID password. Affiliates IMPORTANT: The process for requesting a NetID for Affiliates/Sponsored Accounts at Duke has changed. Requests are no longer accepted via email. Please follow this new procedure:
prompt: How can I request a sponsored guest Unique ID & NetID?, completion:  Visit the Sponsored Guest site and follow the directions on the page. Only Duke employees can sponsor an affiliate for an electronic identity (Duke Unique ID and NetID). Requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis and can take up to three business days. They are confirmed back to the requester by email if the requester selected this option upon setup. The site can also be used to check the status of a submitted request. Affiliates are defined as Duke community members who are not recorded in a system of record, such as the  Duke Human Resources system (SAP) or the Duke University student system (SISS). Affiliates can include visiting faculty, visiting scholars and post-docs, medical residents, and contractors. Affiliates can generate the NetID password when they visit the various DukeCard Offices (DUH, DRH, DHRH and CAMPUS) to get their photo IDs. Swiping the new photo ID at a DukeCard Express Station will initiate an online process for creating the NetID password. If affiliates is unable to visit the DukeCard Office, they may contact the appropriate IT Service Desk (below) for assistance in setting the NetID password. NetID Rules The NetID format is abc123, in other words, your full name initials and a number. You cannot pick your own NetID. NetIDs are tied to individuals. OIT does not issue NetIDs to organizations, departments or other groups.NOTE: If you need a departmental email account, please contact your local IT support group. Each person is allowed only one NetID. NetIDs & passwords are only to be used by the NetID owner and should not be shared with spouses or other family members.
prompt: Can I change my NetID? - Contact the OIT Service Desk as NetID's are not changed without certain parameters being met and are a destructive process leave time with no access to Duke online resources, completion:  Common NetID Misconceptions Changing your NetID password will only affect accounts that use NetID authentication. You will know this because when attempting to login, these accounts will redirect you to the famous NetID Services login screen. You may not be aware that you even have a NetID. You were asked to complete an online safety training or sign up for parking and the NetID login screen shown above is completely new to you. However, if you can login to SAP, SISS, DukeHub, PeopleSoft, etc., those applications use NetID authentication and the same password that works for those will work at the NetID Services screen shown above. You have an active NetID and password but you can't login to other applications that use NetID authentication. The most common reason for that is that you may not have an account in those applications and therefore after authenticating, there is nothing to show. Good examples of those accounts are Sakai, or DukeHub.

prompt: Do not use actual words in any language. Hackers use computer programs with dictionaries that quickly run through all regular words., completion:  Create a password that makes use of the first letter of the words of a phrase. For example, if you can remember, "I like working the 2:00 to 8:00 shift" you could turn this into a password that looks like "ILwt2t8". Using a mix of characters creates a strong password. An 8 character password using only lowercase letters and numbers will require 32.6 days for a computer to go through every possible permutation. Change your DHE Password To perform these steps you must know your current DHE/NetID password (they are the same). Depending on whether you use a PIN workstation, Duke Health laptop with encryption or computer, there are different ways to change your password. I. Follow this preferred method if you are on a Duke Health managed workstation or laptop with PGP encryption: 1. Using these instructions will synchronize your PGP password with your new Windows password. a. While logged on any Duke Health workstation or laptop with your DHE account, press the CTRL + ALT + Delete buttons, and then choose the Change a Password option. b. Click the DHE/{username} option. c. Type your Current Password, New Password, and Confirm new password. Click the blue > button to submit your update. 2. After changing your password, complete these steps to sync your password with your PGP password. a. Reboot your machine by clicking Start, and select Restart. b. At the PGP login screen, type your "old" DHE password. c. At the Windows login screen, type your DHE username and your "new" DHE password. IMPORTANT: After logging in successfully, the system will sync your PGP authentication with your Windows password. d. At this point, you must reboot your desktop (Start > Restart). When logging in again type your "new" password at the PGP screen and proceed to login in the Windows screen by typing your DHE ID and new password. If this fails, type your "old" password at the PGP screen and repeat c. and d. II. From the Duke Self Service Page a. Go to the Duke Self Service site at http://oit.duke.edu/selfservice and login with your current DHE account name and password. b. From the > NetID section, click Change Password. c. Type your Current Password, New Password, and Confirm new password. Click Submit. d. You must change your password on all devices configured with your Duke account (e.g. cell phones, tablets, iPads). Usually this can be done from Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars on your device. (See the List of Devices section below.) Reset and Sync your DHE and NetID Password If you recently reset your password and now are locked out of your workstation, wait 10 minutes and try again. If you are using a different device (see List of Devices below) other than the one on which you originally reset your password, you may be getting locked out because you must update your other devices using Duke account settings with the new password (see the List of Devices section). Before resetting your password you must know your DHE or NetID user ID (they are the same), your Duke Unique ID number, and have your Challenge/Response questions set up. 1. Access the Duke University Password Reset site at https://idms.oit.duke.edu/pwreset/ and complete the fields on the Step 1 screen: a. Enter your NetID and Duke Unique ID (the 7-digit number located on the back of your Duke ID badge). b. Select your date of birth from the drop-down fields. 2. Click Submit to advance to the Step 2 screen. 3. Answer your challenge questions (answers must be correctly punctuated); click Submit to advance to the Step 3 screen. 4. Change your password using the Duke password standards (listed above). 5. Click Submit to reset your password. You will receive an automated email notification that your challenge/response questions were accessed during a password reset. Your new password will sync on all related applications. 6. Update your new password on all devices that access your account. Forgetting this step will result in your account repeatedly getting locked. Duke Health PGP encrypted machines:  If your password is reset in Active Directory (AD) on the domain controller (e.g. by a Service Desk Analyst); the next time you reboot your laptop: a. In the PGP login screen type your "old" password (the previous password before it was reset). You will then be taken to the Windows login screen. b. Login with your DHE username, and type your "new" password. c. After successfully logging into your laptop, reboot your machine (click Start > Restart). This will sync the PGP and Windows password. d. Log back into your machine using your new password at the PGP screen and Windows login.
prompt: When resetting your password you must update all devices that access your account; failing to do this step may result in your account repeatedly getting locked. Depending on the device check your Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars or similar setting., completion:  Devices include: Outlook clients configured with your Duke account on other machines. Cell phones, tablets, and iPads configured with your Duke account (e.g. email account). Network drives mapped on computers. Devices setup to connect to Duke wireless networks. In Active Directory account types are broken down into a number of different categories. In most cases the account owner may reset their passwords (as described above). Standard NetID user accounts Administrative accounts Training accounts Test accounts Service accounts (password minimum of 15 characters) Generic or Kiosk user accounts For all other account password resets, it may depend if the account is in the Duke University domain, or in the Duke Health domain. This is important as a request must be sent to the Service Desk to reset these passwords on behalf of a user; due to the requestor may not have the proper access rights to reset the password (e.g. a Kiosk account). If you need assistance: Visit http://dhts.duke.edu/ and submit a request ticket via Get IT or to notify us about an IT issue or incident via Fix IT.

The purpose of this document is to remind everyone of the Duke University policy regarding the collection, storage, or use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs). This policy is in place, due to the potential risk of identity theft and the resulting hardships to those affected individuals, as well as to the reputational damage to Duke. Identity theft has increased over the years, and it is important to verify that your department is adhering to these policies: Departments wishing to collect, store, or use SSNs must request approval from the Compliance Office. Annual audits of the electronic storage may be conducted, including the server and application security. The process for obtaining approval for the collection, storage, or use of SSNs is outlined below: 1. The department or unit wishing to collect, store, or use SSNs requests must submit a Social Security Exception Request at Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance (eGRC). 2. Click on Exception Requests tab 3. Click on New Record link under Navigation Menu -> Exception Requests on the left side 4. Complete the form and change Submission Status to Submit for Review to submit it to the Compliance Office. If you have any questions regarding this memo, please contact the Duke Medicine Information Security Office via e-mail at iso@mc.duke.edu. Reference: Protecting the Confidentiality of Social Security Numbers Policy Duke University SSN Usage Policy Tallman Trask 2003 Memo The maximum number of users/groups that can be assigned rights to an AFS directory is 18. If you try to add more than 18 users and groups, you will receive an error message stating that you can not save the ACL (Access Control List).

prompt: What is the difference between an appointment, a meeting and an all day event?, completion:  An appointment is an activity that involves only you. Use an appointment when you want to show that you're busy but no one else in your organization is involved. You might enter an appointment to block out time in your calendar when you need to meet with a client, visit the dentist, or research a project you're working on. A meeting is similar to an appointment. The difference is that you invite other people to it. An all day event is an activity that lasts all day long but doesn't block out time in your Calendar. Use an all day event when you want to show an activity that occurs on a specific day without having it clutter up all of the time slots in your calendar.

prompt: What is it?, completion:  Exchange users can remotely wipe their own mobile devices or Outlook mobile through Outlook Web Access.
prompt: Why would you do it?, completion:  For security reasons, if your phone, tablet, or other mobile device goes missing, you may want to prevent anyone who finds it from gaining access to your data.  If the device is linked to your Exchange account, you can erase it from any computer, even if it isn't in your possession.  This can apply to any such device that uses ActiveSync to send and receive Exchange mail, calendar, and contacts.
prompt: What does it do?, completion:  Remotely wiping a mobile device returns it to factory settings.  This means that all mail and calendar data is deleted from the device, but also all other data (such as personal photos, music, and other items) are deleted too.  Most devices that can send and receive phone calls will still be able to do so after a remote wipe. Remote wiping Outlook Mobile removes Outlook email and calendar data from the device but does not factory reset the device.
prompt: How do you do it?, completion:  Open Outlook Web Access from this URL: http://mail.duke.edu Log in with your NetID and NetID password. Click the gear icon, also known as "Settings" (in the top right corner).  A menu appears. Choose "Mail" at the bottom of the menu. Click "General"  from the left navigation bar. Click "Mobile Devices" from the left navigation bar.  A list of registered devices appears. Follow either Remote Wipe a Phone to Factory Settings or Remote Wipe the Outlook Application Only below. Remote Wipe a Phone to Factory Settings Note: If Duke email is not setup on the device's native email client then you will not be able to remote wipe the device to factory settings. If a device is listed (Android, iPhone, Phone model number etc) selecting this option will factory reset your device. This means that all mail and calendar data is deleted, but also all other data (such as personal photos, music, and other items) are deleted too.  Most devices that can send and receive phone calls will still be able to do so after a remote wipe. Select the mobile phone that you want to wipe and remove from the list. (This will display as Android/iPhone or model number not Outlook) 2. Click the mobile device icon. 3. A warning message appears: "Are you sure you want to wipe Outlook? After the device wipe is complete, remove the device from the list." 4. Click yes The Status field for your device may first display "Wipe Pending".  Press the Refresh button; eventually this field should display "Wipe Successful."  Your device has been wiped, or it will be the next time it joins a wireless network. Remote Wipe the Outlook Application Only If Outlook Mobile is listed then selecting this option will not factory reset the phone, it will only reset the email application.  This means that only email and calendar data is deleted from the application. If Outlook Mobile is installed and setup and you do not have the native email client setup for Duke mail you will only be able to remote wipe the application and not the device. Select the mobile phone that you want to wipe and remove from the list. 2. Click the mobile device icon. 3. Choose either "Wipe all data", or "Wipe only data related to this account". 4. A warning message appears: "Are you sure you want to wipe Outlook? After the device wipe is complete, remove the device from the list." 5. Click Yes. Re-using a wiped device If you recover your device and want to use it with Exchange again: Find your device in the list.  Select it, and click "Remove".

From the drop-down box that has a time in it, select the length of time you would like to extend your reservation by. Click Confirm Changes. You can only extend a reservation by 3 hours at once.

prompt: How and where can I obtain a digital security certificate/SSL certificate?, completion:  Please visit the OIT web site to request an InCommon/Comodo certificate: https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/ssl-certificate The photos that are taken for a user's Duke Card are stored in the Duke database.  An individual may access their personal photo, but not those of others. View your personal photo To access your photo, you must either be on campus or using the VPN to connect to the University network. To view your photo, you must first Log in to Duke Internal Directory Got to Duke Internal Directory Click on "Log in" located on the upper right hand side of the screen (see screenshot) to authenticate with your NetID and password. Type your name in the  field under "Search for People" (see screenshot) and press enter, this will need to be entered exactly as it appears in the directory.  If you want to confirm how your name appears in the directory. Click on your name under "Search result" and you picture should be on the right hand side next to your contact information. OIT can not release the photos of others without permission from Duke Human Resources.  You would have to contact Duke HR (www.hr.duke.edu) to discuss with them the release of photos other than your own. You will receive a failed delivery notification email if any text message sent to your phone through the Duke SMS text service is not successfully delivered.  This can occur if you send a test message or if a DukeAlert notification is sent.  In some cases you may receive a failed delivery notification when you have not sent a test message. I tried to send a test message and did not receive it. Once you register for the Duke SMS text service, you will automatically be enrolled to receive the emergency notifications.  You also have the option to send a test message to your phone to confirm that you are able to receive these notifications.  A message may not be delivered for any of the following reasons: If you send a test message just after requesting your account, it may take up to 24 hours for the account to be first created and then the test message to be sent.  In some cases it will take longer for your cellular service provider to accept the message.  If you do not receive the test message or delivery notification failure, you may wait another day or two before sending another test message. If service providers are changed it may take anywhere from 10 days to 90 days for the new provider to accept messages from a bulk provider like Rave. There are also some instances where the service provider may block these messages indefinitely, believing they are SPAM. On rare occasions a service provider's SMS servers may fail as well, resulting in a period where messages cannot be delivered. Any one of these cases may result in a failed delivery notification email or a test message not being delivered to your phone.  You may wait for a later time to send another test message, or contact your cellular service provider to inquire about their policy on receiving SMS texts from bulk SMS services. I received a failed delivery notification email but did not send a test message. If you receive a failed delivery notification and did not send a test message and there have not been any DukeAlert notifications, the notification may have occurred due to a failed wireless look-up by the SMS texting provider that Duke is working with (Rave Wireless).  We have found this typically occurs if you change service providers but will also happen if at any time Rave is unable to verify your cellular number with your provider for any number of other reasons. Unfortunately, the email that is sent when this occurs does not accurately state what has occurred but rather refers to a message failure. The most common cause for Rave Wireless to report a failed look-up for a number is if service providers are changed.  It may take anywhere from 10 days to 90 days for the new provider to accept messages from a bulk provider like Rave. You will only receive the initial email notification. You can also visit https://www.getrave.com/login/duke and register in order to verify your phone number is added correctly or add additional numbers. If you have any questions or would like to have the status of your account and message checked, please contact the OIT Service Desk.

(Windows, Linux and IOS) My DHE NetID, Administrator, Test or Service account locks out. While attempting to log into the DHE domain the account appears to be continually locking out. Customer changed their dhe password today and after awhile it keeps locking up many times. Please verify that your account is locking out in the DHE domain by going to the following URL: https://admgt.dhe.duke.edu/index.php?mnu=lockout Look under the column"user id" and locate the NetID in question. (If you click on the header you can sort the data.) Resolution Identity Management's goal is to ensure that your NetID account is active and is able to log into the Duke Health Enterprise (DHE) Domain. If you are able to authenticate (login) to the DHE Domain and there are no Active Directory (AD) attributes affecting your ability to log into the system, then your account in AD is working as intended. If you have already logged into AD, and then your account locks there is something other than AD associated with your logon that is locking your account. ABOUT LOCKOUTS:Account lockouts happen somewhere in the network when either a NetID or an application attempts to login to AD, PIN workstation or the Wi-Fi Network more than 5 times using an incorrect password. One of these systems will then lock the account for 10 minutes, then automatically release the lock. If the account seems to be continuously locked out, it is due an automated application is attempting to login every few seconds or so using an old password or a cached password saved on one or multiple machines or hand held devices. In AD terms, an account lockout proves that either AD, the PIN Workstation environment, or the Diamonds Network is doing its job. The user was able to be authenticated somewhere in these systems but some other application is causing the account to lock. IdM have identified a number of situations that can cause account lockouts and we strongly recommend that Desktop support assist  you in resolving this problem. SUPPORT INFORMATION If you need assistance or have questions, please contact the Duke Medicine Service Desk at 919-684-2243 or go to https://duke.service-now.com and from Self-Service submit a request ticket. Common Causes for Account Lockouts that we should examine are: Account Lockout for Remote ConnectionsActive Directory replication (This is always closely monitored and is an unlikely cause)Auto run jobs and commands with hard coded passwords, example: RunAsBad Password Threshold is set too low (5 Retries, then locked for 15 minutes)Cached passwords, IE or ApplicationDisconnected Terminal Server sessionsInternet Information ServicesMSN Messenger and Microsoft Outlook, Jabber or some other Messaging systemPersistent drive and printer mappingsScheduled tasks (starting programs that require an account and password)Service accountsStart-up Programs (At boot time)Stored user names and passwords retain redundant credentialsUser logging on to multiple computers and not logging offSpecific groups missing from the NetID, for example: VPN Searching Splunk for Account Lockouts: If the account is being locked out and the Events are being captured, the more detail you can gather to resolve the issue the better. Splunk will have sufficient information for the tech to identify major components by drilling deeper into the issue. Below are two examples used in mining Splunk for additional support information. For a generic search in Splunk where accounts have locked out more than 5 times use:       index=windows fail* password | stats count by User_Name | where count > 5For a more specific search on an account use: (Note change to NetID you are searching for  Account_Name=NetID)       sourcetype="*WinEventLog:Security" Message="An account failed to log on*" Account_Name=maars001 | stats count by Account_Name | where count >= 1 | table Account_Name, Account_Domain, ComputerName, dest, src_ip, src_port, Workstation_Name *** Instructions for End-User IT Support Group ***  Please follow the instructions below: (These instructions may vary depending on the O/S installed on the machine logging out.)1) Please turn off all hand held devices.2) If you have 2 or more computers, turn off all machines except one (work off one device at a time).3) Remove all cached passwords in IE and in the Windows OS. "There are some commands available that does this depending on the O/S."  Your local IT support team should know how to clear this. (See examples below)4) Remove any roaming profile.5) Remove all mapped drives.6) Remove all mapped printers. Please run the following commands on the machine that is experiencing account lockouts: Always run CMD from elevated "Administrator: Command Prompt" console: Perform the below steps on client side (Local desktop / Laptop) 1) Check If a Local User Account is present with the same Name as AD account, If same ID is available, Rename local ID to some other ID.2) Clear Temporary Files3) Delete Cookies / Temp Files / History / Saved passwords / Forms / from all the Browsers.4) Start — > Run –> Temp –> Delete all temp files.5) Start –> Run –> Prefetch –> Delete all Prefetch files.6) Remove Mapped drives from my computer. My Computer –> Right click on Shared drive –> click on Disconnect7) If Adobe reader is installed, backend it will be trying to check for latest update, Delete the Adobe updater file from below path. Delete the AdobeUpdater.dll file in the folder C:\Program Files\Adobe\Reader version \Reader8) Remove stored passwords from Control Panel9) Start –> Run –> Type: Control UserPasswords2 , Click on Advanced managed passwords and delete all the passwords10) Remote unwanted applications from startups (Run ??> msconfig –> startup –> Uncheck unwanted software’s)11) Scan the entire HDD and update the Antivirus agent12) Check the third party software’s installed on client side, If it’s not required, Uninstall.13) Open the Task Scheduler (Run --> Tasks) and delete the unwanted tasks. Most of the time, Automatic backup / Google Update / Apple Updates will be installed by default) Remove all.14) Uninstall Auto update software’s in control panel (You can update these software’s manually)15) If user’s account acts as a service account (Update the latest password in Service).16) User’s account used as an IIS application pool identity. Also  1) SET >c:\temp\myset.txt (so you have a hard copy) Check the following parameter: LOGONSERVER=\\...DHE-DCxxx This will tell you that the user is authenticating against the DHE AD. 2) GPRESULT /USER NetID /V >c:\temp\GPRESULT_u.txt {Note replace NetID with the account reporting lockout} 3) OR--> GPRESULT /r >c:\temp\GPRESULT_r.txt 4) Open gpedit.msc or RSoP  Open gpedit.msc or RSoP (Start -> Run -> gpedit.msc -> click OK).  Look at the user configuration Windows settings Scripts Logon. 5) Still under gpedit.msc or RSoP - Clear out the password cache: Under Computer Configuration drill down to  Windows Settings -> Security Settings ->  Local Policies -> Security Options.  Look for policy: Interactive Logon:  Number of previous logons to cache...  Set this number to 0 (default is 10).  6) Under IE Open Internet Options Under Browsing History Select Delete and clear out All cached passwords To delete the Cached Credentials:Open a Command Prompt Run " Psexec.exe -s -i regedit.exe " without quotes Navigate to HKLM\SECURITY\Cache Delete all NL$1 through NL$10 For further DC information details, you can copy the netlogon.log file from the domain controller where the account is being locked out from. Copy that to c:\Temp folderRun the following against the Netlogon file COPIED from the DC to filter out the lockouts:  type: c:\Temp\netlogon.log |find /i "0xC000006A" >badpassword.txt  type: c:\Temp\netlogon.log |find /i "0xC0000234" >lockedout.txt Restart the computer and check if the cache was cleared    Remove any startup batch file, reboot the machine and see if you can log in. If there are additional machines or devices involved where the account is being locked out, start the process again from the beginning. If the problem still persists, please send the logon bat file (or whatever file is used for the startup) as well as the GPRESULT_u.txt, GPRESULT_r.txt and myset.txt, to your local favorite IT support group to go through. Based on batch files used one could determine what is causing the problem, but there are many files to work through. At a last resort, IdM could work with the local IT Support group, together with the user, to resolve this issue. However, "IT Desktop Support" is a little outside of Identity Managements role. Additional information about Account Lockouts: If you don't  find records in the URL: https://admgt.dhe.duke.edu/index.php?mnu=lockout -OR- in Splunk, the cause may be due to user logging into DHE from an external location. Please check and ensure that the user has access to VPN so that they can login remotely. If you need assistance: Service Now Assignment Group: EIS-OIT

There is a delay when creating Adjustments in OnBase. A document lock is not released when the approval path is built. The Adjustment is then sent to the Approval Path Exceptions queue. The system may take 10 - 15 minutes to process and appear in the queue, if no other problem exists. The expectation should be that the import to OnBase is not immediate. The Support@Duke Knowledge Base text search allows you to search the knowledge base for specific articles, and then filter, organize, and refine your results. Articles are accessible depending on your access rights to Support@Duke. IT Support Staff can search the knowledge base directly from forms (e.g. incident, request, and problem records) from the Short Description field by clicking the "Search Knowledge" book icon. Using Advanced Search you can filter your search results by All, Support@Duke Knowledge Base (contains how-to's, informational documents targeting end users), and the Support@Duke Internal Knowledge Base (contains technical documentation used by IT Support Staff). You can Sort by Relevancy, Views, and Last Updated. Knowledge base keyword search terms are stemmed, meaning that search terms may return similar words (e.g. searching "print" will return "printing" and vice versa). NOTE: For additional information on searching the knowledge base, please visit the ServiceNow DocSite https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/reference/r_KnowledgeSearch.html (If the direct URL link does not open, please right-click the URL link and select Open in New Window.) Zing, the global search engine, searches the knowledge base along with other types of records. Many Zing settings apply to the knowledge base search. This also allows users to search the knowledge base using global text search. In order to return the most relevant search results, each document is given a score (numeric value) that represents its relevancy to the query. The components of a score are: Frequency: How often search terms appear. Points are awarded to a document for the frequency (one point per occurrence) in which the search terms appear anywhere in the document. Sequence: How often search terms appear in order. A document receives more points for containing the search terms in the order they were typed. Weight: How heavily weighted the field is in which the terms appear. A document may potentially receive more points based on which field in the document contains a particular search term. A multiplier is applied to frequency or sequence points based on the value of the ts_weigh attribute on a particular field. The default is to score 1 point per match, but a match in a field with a ts_weight=50, for example, would score 50 points. The following fields have elevated scoring weights: kb_knowledge.number = 50 points (e.g. KB0013211) kb_knowledge.title = 10 points (the article Title field) kb_knowledge.meta = 10 points (the meta field, which contains keyword search terms) To perform a single character wildcard search, use the percent sign (%) symbol. This wildcard finds terms that contain any one character to replace the percent sign. For example, to find text or test, search for te%t To perform a multiple character wildcard search, use the asterisk (*) symbol. This wildcard finds terms that contain 0 or more characters to replace the asterisk. For example, to find planned or placed, search for pl*d Use quotation marks to search for a phrase with multiple terms. Zing finds only matches that contain the exact words in the exact order you specify, ignoring stop words (common words that are excluded from searches) and punctuation. For example, "email password" or "email a password"  return the same results because the stop word a is ignored. Wildcards do not work within quoted phrases; they are ignored as punctuation. Boolean operators combine search terms with logic operators. The following searches support Boolean operators: Global text search Knowledge Base Lists (text searches of all fields) For these searches, the AND operator is applied by default, which means if no Boolean operator is entered between two terms, the AND operator is used. For knowledge base searches, if the AND search returns poor results, the search is automatically re-run with the OR operator. Boolean operators are case-sensitive. For example, OR is an operator while or is a search term that may be a stop word. OR or vertical bar symbol (l) - Finds a match if either of the terms exists in a article. For example, to find articles that contain either "email password" or just "email", search for: "email password" OR email "email password" l email AND - Finds a match if both terms exist in an article. For example, to find articles that contain "CPU load" and "10 minutes", search for: "CPU load" AND "10 minutes" Additional Information To submit a comment or question regarding the information contained in this article, click Send Feedback.

Personal rooms are part of WebEx Meetings and are a great choice for impromptu meetings, re-occurring events that you regularly host, and one on one meetings like office hours.  If other people need to host and run the meeting you are scheduling or you need more advanced feature like break-out rooms consider using an alternative WebEx tool. Request your account at webex.duke.edu.  You will receive an email confirming your account has been set up. All Duke Health and Duke University faculty, staff, and students are able to request a free WebEx web-conferencing account.  Your account will be setup with all WebEx tools To add audio calling options to your account, you will need to provide a fund code (cost center).  Audio calling charges will be applied to your account at a per minute rate. Get Setup: Prepare your device(s): Be sure that your device has a working camera and for the best quality audio, use a headset with a microphone.  WebEx will work with any standard headset that your device supports. Set your personal preferences: Login at Webex.duke.edu. Use the left navigation pane Set Up, Preferences, to set up your personal preferences and defaults.  We suggest: under My Personal Room: set your room name, and a memorable PIN which is used to start your room from a phone or video conferencing system.  If you are using your personal room for 1 on 1 meetings like office hours, or have meetings of a sensitive nature, you may also want to lock your room by default. This can also be done on a per meeting basis after you launch the meeting. Install the WebEx Meetings App: The first time you launch WebEx the Meetings App should install automatically.  If you have an older version, such as "Productivity Tools" you may have to install the App manually.  Visit Collaborationhelp.cisco.com for these instructions. Run your first meeting:  With Webex personal rooms you can add attendees, schedule, and start the meeting in a variety of ways.  Since the web link and phone numbers never change, just pick the one(s) easiest for you: From the web: Login to WebEx at webex.duke.edu and select Start Meeting from your home screen.  Once the meeting has started, you will have a variety of on screen options to invite attendees to the meeting. From the WebEx Meetings client: Launch the 'Cisco WebEx Meetings' client on your computer and start or schedule your meeting. Schedule a meeting: you can use Outlook or another calendar tool to create and manage an invite as you would normally.  To add a WebEx personal room meeting, either use WebEx icon in Outlook to add the links for you, or simply copy and paste the links from an invite generated from the web as above From the phone: if you have audio options enabled on your account and are unable to access a computer to start your meeting, you can start your meeting from the phone by following the voice prompts under the Join by Phone section in the invite.  You will need the Host PIN you set in your preferences.  If you plan to use audio only, instead of using a WebEx personal room, you should instead use a WebEx Personal Conference Number. Need more help?  Visit Lynda for WebEx Training or out WebEx FAQ for tips and tricks. A host would like to have international participation for their WebEx Meeting but needs to know the international call in numbers. First check to see if your country is on the Global Call In List Here: https://dukeuniversity.webex.com/dukeuniversity/globalcallin.php https://dukemed.webex.com/dukemed/globalcallin.php Note: They both should be the same, but to avoid confusion, provide the link corresponding to the requestor's site. If they are not supported as a call in customer, please check the global telephone rate sheet referenced below. If they are listed there as a country supported by "Call Me Back", then they can use the "Call Me Back" feature of WebEx Web Conferencing to call them back when they join the web conference. This cannot be used for telephone only conferences (using PCN for example) https://duke.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0014179 If the country does not exist in either page, they are not supported by WebEx and the participant will have to select a number close to them that they can dial from their region. Duke will not pay their toll costs if there is a fee.

prompt: How to restrict access to http://people.duke.edu/ content or to http://web.duke.edu/shared-space content., completion:  All users with CIFS personal home directory space have the capacity for visible web content in the folder public_html. Web content stored in this folder appears at the address http://people.duke.edu/~netid , where netid is the user's NetID. Some users may also have legacy web content that was originally hosted in AFS which has been migrated to CIFS. In most cases, the content appears at the address http://web.duke.edu/shared-space where shared-space is the name of the web space project. It is possible to restrict access to part or all of this content using Shibboleth authentication. In the previous AFS environment, this authentication was done via WebAuth. If you had set up access restrictions under AFS, be aware your restrictions will not be recognized and the content will not be available until the file controlling access is updated. Follow these steps to create or modify the file that controls access to web content. Connect to your CIFS home directory or web space: Directions for Windows (see KB0013655). Directions for Mac (see KB0013637). SSH to login.oit.duke.edu For personal home directories, change directories into the public_html directory (NOTE: this is not necessary for the web space as you are already in a location that is web-accessible). Navigate into the folder that needs to have access restrictions. Be aware you can control access at the directory level but not to individual files. Create a new plain text document named .htaccess (note the beginning period). If you had previously restricted content, this file should already exist.  (Note that this is treated as a "hidden file" in many operating systems.) Enter or modify the file with the following text: AuthType ShibbolethShibRequestSetting RequireSession OnRequire valid-user Save the document. Additional options The .htaccess file can also be modified toward a specific audience. Require user netid1@duke.edu netid2@duke.edu  (separated by spaces) will restrict to a set of netids. Require faculty@duke.edu (or staff, emeritus, student, affiliate) for a set grouping of Duke users. For changes to Undergraduate and Graduate mailing address (or in DukeHub) students should contact the registrar's office by emailing registrar@duke.edu with the following information: Duke Unique ID (7 digits on back of your Duke Card Full Name Old address New address To view hidden files in the Mac OS X Finder, a change must be made using Terminal. Open Terminal. Type the following command and press Enter: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall -HUP Finder Finder restarts.  After a restart, any hidden files will be visible. To revert this change: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall -HUP Finder Finder restarts.  After a restart, hidden files will no longer be shown. Required Documentation Users: Inpatient Nurses Priority: NEVER a critical or high issue Unlike it's name implies required documentation is not really required in Epic. It is a tool to help nurses ensure that all per policy documentation is completed. Most of these checks run on Admission required documentation and there is some documentation that is required for a nursing Shift. This documentation is located primarily within the nursing Admission navigator and includes such things as an activities of daily living assessment, discharge planning assessment, and suicide assessment. To satisfy the requirement generally EACH and EVERY flowsheet row within those section of the navigator require a response, EVEN the FREE TEXT rows. Required documentation is the same for all adult units; pediatric units have slightly different requirements. Common Questions: 1) Can I see a report detailing what is required and what is not yet documented? Yes, Patient List report 'Req Doc' [3049900002], see screenshot below. Select the 'Req Doc' report which a patient highlighted in a My List. 2) Can I see EXACTLY what row or field is required? No, in general though for the admission navigator every field needs to be documented per DUHS policy.

By default, Office 365 e-mail distribution groups are configured to only accept messages from the Duke Office 365 system senders.  If an e-mail distribution group needs to be able to receive messages from senders outside of the Duke Office 365 mail system, department IT Support should request the group configuration be modified to accept messages from senders outside of the Duke Office 365 mail system. Department IT Support staff should submit a request to OIT Collaborative Services requesting the option "Require that all senders are authenticated" be disabled for the distribution group. Exchange Shared Folder management using Active Directory groups An Exchange Shared Folder or Mailbox permits a user or group of users to share a common resource within Exchange. This folder is usually email enabled and access is managed using two groups within the Active Directory domain WIN.DUKE.EDU. Each group serves a distinct purpose: XXX-sharedfoldername-fa - Members of this group have complete management of the contents of the shared folder and can create subfolders, delete and manage incoming mail, access the calendar, etc. Through the use of "profiles" in Outlook, these group members can grant access to components within the shared mailbox to other users who are not members of the *-fa group. However, members of this group cannot grant access to the "root" folder. Administrative users must by added to the *-fa folder by a designated OU admin (ex. XXX-ou-admins). XXX-sharedfoldername-sa - Members of this group have the ability to send messages that appear as though they came from the shared folder. This can apply to email, calendars, tasks, etc. This can be illustrated by preparing a new message but selecting the "Options" link to enable the "From" address field. Members of this group should be able to select the shared folder to appear in the "From" address. Be aware that members of XXX-sharedfoldername-fa do not have "send as" privileges. In order for a user to have all access to an Exchange shared folder, they must be a member of both groups. The "full access" group does have some limitations: they cannot delete the shared folder. they cannot grant access to other users to the shared folder that match the permissions of the XXX-sharedfoldername-fa group.
prompt: When shared folders are created, any netids provided in the ticket as needing full access are added to both groups. Going forward, any users requesting administrative rights should be added to both groups., completion:  Members of the "full access" group can grant access to other users using Outlook and these users with editor permissions can grant access to other users. It is not a requirement that a user be a member of the "full access" or "send as" groups to gain access to a shared folder or resource. See the following documents for descriptions on setting permissions to Exchange folders Outlook 2010 - How to Share Exchange Calendar, Contacts or TasksOutlook 2010 / 2011 - Accessing a Duke University Exchange Shared Mailbox or Calendar (note this article applies only to members of the full access group - it will not work for delegates)Duke Exchange - Permission Levels ReferenceDuke University Exchange - Resource Manager Guide We recommend not using iCal with your Office 365 calendar.  For more information, please see KB0022753.

Windows 8: Windows 7: 2.  Create a new profile.  Use a descriptive name like "Duke Exchange" or "Duke Office 365". 3.  You will now be prompted with the following screen.  Enter your name, preferred email address, and NetID password as seen and select Next. Important: For email address, use your netid@duke.edu. Use your netid@duke.edu even if this isn't your email address - that is the address that Outlook will need to look for in order to set up your account. 4.  An autodiscover prompt will now appear.  Select Allow. 5.  You may now be prompted with the following screen.  If so, select Yes.  Otherwise, continue to the next step. 6.  You'll now see the following.  Select Finish. 7.  You may now open Outlook.  You'll be prompted for username and password.  Enter your netid@duke.edu as the username and NetID password in the password field.  (Ex. for NetID duketester, the username field would read duketester@duke.edu).  Select "Remember my credentials" if you don't wish to be prompted for them every time your profile is accessed. 8.  Your Outlook software should now open and begin to download a local copy of your mailbox.  Depending on the size of your mailbox and connection speed, this may take some time.  Once your mailbox has downloaded, you're all set! While this documentation is written for the latest release of Mac OS X, the directions can be applied to earlier releases including Mac OS 10.5 - 10.10. Be aware there are some minor and major differences (ex. iCal is called "Calendar" in earlier versions of Mac OS X). Major differences include the look of the dialog boxes. In some instances, it can take time for all components to be in place for configuring Mac Mail. In the interim, you can always access your mail by going to https://mail.duke.edu. Open Mail, and then do one of the following: If you've never set up any e-mail accounts using Mail, a new window will drop down. In the Choose a Mail account provider window, select Exchange and Continue. If you've already created e-mail accounts using Mail, your client will open as normal. Go to the Mail menu and select Add Account. In the Choose a Mail account provider window, select Exchange and Continue. In the window that appears enter the following information: In the Name box, enter your name. In the Email Address box, enter your netid@duke.du. In the Password box, enter the password for your NetID, and then click Sign In. The Mail program will use the information you entered in the previous step to try to set up your e-mail account automatically. If the Mail program was able to set up your account, you can select the "apps" you want to set up for the Office 365 account including: Mail (the program you are configuring) Contacts which connects to the Office 365 Global Address List (GAL) to the Address Book program Calendars which configures the Calendar program included in Mac OS X. Reminders which sets up the "To Do" list program in Mac OS X. Notes which synchronizes documents across devices and clients. After you've selected the options you want, Click <Done. Please allow a few moments for the Mail program to download your mail to the local client. If this fails, wait a few minutes or hours, and then repeat these steps. If at a later time, you want to disable apps such as those using Contacts or Calendars, follow these steps: Launch System Preferences -> Internet Accounts. Select the Exchange account listed on the left (do not select Exchange from the provider list on the right). Deselect the component you wish to disable and close the window. RECOMMENDATION: For managing your Office 365 calendar, please use Outlook or Outlook Web Access (available from http://mail.duke.edu). You can use the Calendar program included with Mac OS X but exercise caution accepting invitations from or creating invitations to fellow Duke Office 365 users. Duke Health Users:  To view updated support documentation for Incident and Request processes that are specific to Duke Medicine, please visit the Service Excellence Documentation Hub and look in the Incident and Requests Document section. All Other Users:  Please see the attached Support@Duke Request Fulfillment Guide for instructions on how to enter and process a request as a IT support person. Support@Duke Request Fulfillment Guide To be used by ITIL role (Service Desk or IT support personnel) Abstract: This document is a reference guide for IT support staff with an ITIL Role in Support@Duke on how to process generic and password reset service requests. Overview of Service Requests A Service Request is typically a request for information, or advice, or for a small change to minor change or for access to a service or application. Examples are password resets, software installation on a laptop, or a request to move, add, or change a telephone line/number. In Support@Duke Service Requests are handled very similarly to the way orders are handled at Amazon.com. There are three parts to the Service Requests in Support@Duke: 1. The Request itself, and 2. The Request Item (often referred to as RITM). 3. A Task For Generic Requests, with which this Guide is mostly concerned, there is a one to one to one relationship between the Request and the Requested Item and the Task. For Specific Requests there may be one-to-many relationships between a Request, Requested Item and associated Tasks. Using “Create New Generic Request” Link in Service Desk Module If you know that the ticket you are creating is for a “Generic” Service Request you can use the Create New Generic Request link. CAUTION: Please make sure that there is not a specific service catalog item pre-defined that should be used via the “New Call” form prior to using this method. 1. Clicking “Create New Generic Request” opens the Catalog Task form. Note that the Task Number is pre-populated. Begin by filling in the Requested for field (this should auto populate the Business Phone and Service Provider fields): 2. The Category field defaults to Service Request. After reviewing the ticket information, if it needs to be changed to Information Request or How-To, make the appropriate selection. Note that for these two categories there are no associated subcategories. 3. If you select Service Request, the Subcategory field will need to be populated with valid options. 4. Select the proper Legacy CI from the “Lookup from list” panel (i.e. search with magnifying glass icon.)  5. Select the appropriate Contact type from the drop down list.  6. Select the appropriate State from the drop down list. Default value is set to “Open”. NOTE: If you have completed the request task (and all required fields are completed) you can change the task “State” to “Closed Complete” then click the “Update” button. This will submit and complete (i.e. close) the task in one action. It is recommended that if you are continuing to work on a task that this step not be used since closing the task, closes the RITM and REQ for a generic and password reset request. For specific requests, the preferred method for closing would be to use the “Close Task” button. This button is not available for the generic or password reset requests. 7. Select the appropriate Urgency.  If choosing Urgent, the Reason for Urgency and Due Date fields become required.  8. Select Due date (optional unless ticket is marked Urgent) by clicking the calendar icon. This establishes a desired delivery date but provides no triggers or notifications and does not guarantee that this date will be met.  9. Select the appropriate Assignment group using the “Lookup using list” icon, (magnifying glass), which is opened in a new window. Using this option gives you a more comprehensive list from which to choose. You may also type the first few letters of the Group name and the system will present a shortened list in the same window. Once the Assignment group is populated the Task may be assigned to a specific individual if desired (see Good Practice note below). Good Practice: It is preferred that you pick the assignment group and not a specific assignee to ensure proper handling of the request. This rationale is used in order to ensure someone will be available to work the request in the event the specific individual is out of the office for an extended period of time. 10. Provide a Short description and then provide additional details as necessary in the Work notes field. NOTE: The Description field is available as place to put information like work instructions or information (i.e. scratchpad) but it does not copy this information to the Work Notes or trigger any customer notification like the “Additional Comments” section. 11. Clicking Submit assigns the Task to the designated Assignment Group. 12. The Catalog Task form refreshes, but it now contains the Request item, often noted as “RITM”. 13. Hovering over the Information icon to the right of the RITM field shows the details of the request item such as the Stage, Quantity and Request number. Clicking the information icon will take you to the RITM where you can view the task by clicking the Task link at the bottom. Good Practice: All information and actions taken on a request by an IT support person should be done at the Task and not the RITM level. 14. You can navigate back to the Task by clicking the TASK link at the bottom of the RITM form. 15. You have now completed opening a Request and assigning the Task to your group or another assignment group. If you wish to work the task, you can go to the Working the Task section of this document for additional steps. If you or your team plan to complete (i.e. close) this task, go to the Closing a Request Task section in this document to continue this work flow. Searching for “Unassigned” Tickets assigned to your Group 1. Clicking “My Groups’ Unassigned Work” opens the Tasks panel and lists the Tasks that are assigned to your default group but do not have a specific technician assigned to work the task.   NOTE: For the Service Desk Groups – this is where you will find tickets in queue to process for customers who have submitted tickets via the self-service Service Catalog. 2. Click on a Task number to open it. NOTE: It may be helpful to write the Task # down to use for searching in “My Work” if you plan to work on the task. 3. To assign a Task to yourself, click on a Task # and enter your name/NetID in the Assigned to: field and click “Update.” You will be taken back to the Unassigned Task list. Note that the Task is no longer listed.  4. You can assign multiple tickets to yourself by checking the boxes in front of the Tasks, right clicking in the gray header bar and selecting Update Selected.  This will open up a new screen in which you can fill in the “Assigned to” field with your NetID and click Update.    5. Click the My Work link and you should notice the Task is now listed here since it has been assigned to you. 6. Go to the Working the Task section of this document to finish processing the request. Finding My Work 1. To find Tasks that have been assigned to you, clicking “My Work” opens the Tasks panel and lists the Tasks that are assigned to you. 2. If you are working the Task, you need to put the Task State to “Work in Progress” and click Update. This will take you back to the Task panel where you will see that the State has changed. 3. When you are ready to document the steps you are performing, or have performed, click the Task link to open the Task and enter your comments in the Work notes. Working a Request Task Once a Task has been assigned to you, you can begin the work necessary to fulfill the request. 1. Click My Work and select a Task to work on and open it. 2. Set State to “Work in Progress” if still in an “Open” status. 3. As you progress through the work you may wish to communicate or inform the Requestor about the status of their request. Enter your information in Additional comments and click Update, which sends an email to the customer with the information. 4. You can also send an email directly without entering anything in the Additional comments field. Click the email icon (the envelope) in the upper right corner. 5. A new window opens with a typical email interface. Enter an email address in the Reply to: field (more than likely should be yours); and your comments in the Message Text field. Notice that your email is CC:, the Requested for userid is prepopulated; you can attach a file and check your spelling and then click the Send button. 6. The window closes and you are taken back to the Catalog Task form. 7. Document your work in the Work notes. NOTE: Please be aware that there is an area called “Sensitive Electronic Information” (i.e. SEI) that should be used for any sensitive information like Medical Record #’s, Social Security #’s etc…. This information is only viewable by the Creation and Assignment Group to protect this data. If you find any PHI (Protected Health Information) or other sensitive data in a record outside this field (i.e. in work notes), open a ticket with Support@Duke asking them to remove this data and place it in the appropriate SEI tab.  For more information please refer to KB0019335. 8. After all the fields have been filled in, if there is more work to be done, click Update. 9. When you are ready to close the Task refer to section Closing a Request Task. CAUTION: The Close Task button is not available for generic and password reset requests. It is only available for specific requests and should not be used to navigate away from this form as it will actually close the task. Converting a Request Task to an Incident If while working the Task it is determined that the issue is an Incident (i.e. something is broken) rather than a Service Request, the Task can be converted to an Incident. 1. While viewing the Task, click the Convert to Incident button located at the top or bottom of the task form. 2. The Task state is changed to Closed Incomplete, and you are taken to the Incident form. NOTE: You can click on the Task link at the top of the new Incident page to go back to the Task if necessary. 3. A new Incident is created and assigned to the group in the Assignment Group field with a Status of “New.” Assigning or Reassigning a Request Task to another Group If while working on the request, you determine that another group should be working on this request, you may reassign the Request Task to another Group. This reassignment would be needed if there is more work to be done to fulfill this Request or if the work does not belong to your Group. 1. Open the Task that needs to be reassigned and complete any required fields (if not filled in already). 2. Set the State to Open. 3. Clear the Assignment group and Assigned to fields. 4. Click on the Lookup using list icon (magnifying glass) next to the Assignment group field and find the group to which you want to assign the request. 5. If you know the name of the group you can type the first few letters and a read-ahead list will appear. 6. Click on the group name to select it. 7. Click “Update.” 8. You will be taken back to your My Work Task list. Note that the Task no longer appears in the My Work Task list. Good Practice: Assigning a task to an assignment group and not an individual assignee is the preferred method to ensure proper and timely processing. Closing a Request Task If you have completed the request task and the customer agrees that the request has been fulfilled, you can close the service request. 1. If the Task is assigned to you, the Task will be in your My Work Task list. 2. Otherwise, from the “Requests” area in the Service Desk Module, perform a search to find the RITM/TASK for the Request you want to close. 3. Open the RITM, scroll to the bottom and click on the associated Task number to open it. 4. Prior to closing the Task document the reason for closure in the Work notes. 5. To Close a generic or password reset request change the State to “Closed Complete” and click Update. 6. You will be taken back to the RITM form. The Stage on the RITM form will now be “Completed.” 7. If you hover over the REQ information icon you will see the main REQ form and you will see the Request State of Closed Complete. Searching for Requests IT staff or customers may want to know the status of a Request. A list of Requests and their associated Requested Items can be found by clicking the Requests link in the Service Desk navigation panel. If you are using this to provide a status update, the associated Task will have the most details about work being performed by the assignment group. The following procedure explains where and how to search for a RITM number and drill down to the TASK form for each Request. 1. Clicking “Requests” opens the Request Items panel. 2. Next to “Go to” you have many different search criteria from which to select. If you are looking for a specific request you can use the “Go to“ Number and type in the RITM number. Once you click the Search icon (magnifying glass) the results will show you the single RITM in a list: 3. In addition to multiple search options, you can “customize” the column headings to your personal preference by using the “gear” icon on the header (upper left) and by adding or removing columns. 4. The rows can also be sorted by clicking on the column headers. 5. Clicking on the Request number takes you to the request form where you can drill down to the RITM and ultimately the Task. You can alternately click on the RITM number which opens the RITM form and allows you to drill down to the Task. NOTE: You can also use the Global search function within Support@Duke to search or the Request Section in the Service Desk navigation panel. NOTE: By clicking on Requests, Items and Tasks in the Request Section area you have multiple search options to choose from for each link. Creating, Saving, Updating and Deleting a Template

Password Resets - NetID Many of Duke’s applications are protected by a single password associated with a NetID. There is a link on the Support@Duke sign in screen, below the Enter button, that will allow a user to reset or change their own password. It is recommended that you encourage end users to attempt to reset their NetID password through this self-service option before submitting a ticket to Support@Duke. If your customers continue to have issues with their NetID password or authentication, you can have them contact the OIT Service Desk for Duke University or DHTS Service Desk for Duke Medicine to triage and assist them with putting in the appropriate type ticket for their issue or you can follow the steps in Creating a Password Reset Request section of this document to open a ticket for them. Send customers to Knowledge Article KB0014614 for assistance in resetting or changing their NetID password.

Note that if you select “No” and assign the Task to your Assignment group, your name will be in the “Assigned to” field, and the Task will appear in your My Work section. 11. Continue working and documenting your work until the Task is complete and following the steps in Closing a Request Task to close the Request. For questions or comments about this document or Request Management in general please feel free to submit a ticket via Service Now (https://duke.service-now.com/ ) Please assign any Duke Health tickets to Service Management-DHTS or DukeUniversity tickets to Service Management-OIT Duke Health Users To view updated support documentation for Incident and Request processes that are specific to Duke Health, please visit the Service Excellence Documentation Hub and look in the Incident and Requests Document section. Duke University Users Overview IT support users have an ITIL User role in Support@Duke.  This role provides access to the modules currently configured in Support@Duke. This guide is written for ITIL Users, and describes how to create, update and resolve tickets (incidents) in Support@Duke. Logging In Any Duke employee with a Duke NetID can access Support@Duke. To log in, do the following: From a Web browser, visit https://duke.service-now.com. The Duke Sign In screen appears. In the NetID box, type your Duke NetID. In the password box, type your NetID password. Click Enter.  The Support@Duke home page appears. Note: Many functions within Support@Duke utilize a right-click.  Users of Mac trackpads may need to use a two-finger click to perform a right-click. Opening a New Incident To open a new incident (ticket) click Create New Incident, located in the left navigation (referred to as the Application Navigator) under the Service Desk heading.  A new Incident screen appears: Completing the Incident Form Follow the instructions provided below to complete the Incident form.  Fields marked with a red asterisk  are required and must be completed to submit the incident. NOTE: Support@Duke’s “type-ahead” functionality can often be used within a field to display a list of options. Caller (Required) – In the Caller field, type the caller’s Duke NetID, or part of their first or last name to use the type-ahead feature.  Select the desired result from the matching results that are displayed in the list. To view the caller’s user record, hover your mouse over the magnifying glass icon. Impact Location and Impact Phone – The Impact Location reflects the place where the customer is experiencing service interruption or requesting assistance.  This may differ from their office, residence or work location.  Begin typing in the field to present a list of matching options, or click the magnifying glass to view a complete list. The Impact Phone should reflect the best phone number at which to reach the caller about the incident. Edit as needed. Category and Subcategory – These fields are not required for Duke University incidents and can be left blank Service Provider (Required) – This field should be auto-populated base on the caller’s affiliation but can be changed if necessary. Populating the Service Provider field first will filter the list of IT Services by provider (e.g. if it is set for Duke University then only University related IT Services will be displayed to select from). IT Service (Required), Service Offering, Application, and Configuration Item – These fields are all related and will auto-populate one another depending on their relationships and the order in which you complete them. Below is a brief description of how this works: IT Service & Service Offering Populating IT Service first will auto-populate the Service Offering field. For the University the Service Offering will be the same as IT Service in the majority of situations. Filling in IT Service will also auto-populate the Service Provider field if it has not been completed. The Application field will be narrowed down to only a list of associated applications when the IT Service is completed first. Application Populating the Application field first will auto-populate Service Offering and IT Service. If the application is associated with more than one Service Offering or IT Service then you will need to select from a filtered list for the most appropriate selection by clicking the magnifying glass icon. This will, in turn, auto-populate the Service Provider field if it has not been completed. Configuration Item This field is not currently being used by the University but eventually will be populated with host names. OIT's IT Services and Applications List - https://duke.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0023502 Impact, Urgency, and Priority (Required) – Support@Duke uses three metrics for determining the order in which incidents are processed: Impact – An incident’s effect on the business (Individual, Widespread or Workgroup) Urgency – The extent to which the incident’s resolution can bear delay (High, Medium or Low) Priority – How quickly the service desk should address the incident Possible values for Priority are: 1 – Critical 2 – High 3 – Moderate 4 – Low You may change an Incident’s Priority.  When you do so, an explanatory note must be entered in the Work Notes field. Note: A warning will be displayed when the priority becomes High or Critical (whether through preferred calculation of Impact & Urgency, or manual manipulation of the priority setting) notifying the user that the Assignment Group will be paged. Contact Type (Required) – In the Contact Type list, select from the available options: Chat, Email, Event, Phone, Self-service, Voicemail and Walk-in Incident State – The Incident State for a new incident is always New. Additional options include Active, Transferred, Awaiting Problem, Awaiting User Info, Awaiting Evidence, Resolved and Closed.  If you assign a ticket to another group change the Incident state to New.  Resolved incidents become Closed after 10 days of inactivity. Assignment Group (Required) and Assigned To – In general Incidents should be assigned only to an Assignment Group so that the group itself can decide who should work the ticket.  In circumstances where a ticket should be assigned to a specific individual then the Assigned to field may be filled out as well.  If you know the individual but not their Assignment Group, then filling their name in the Assigned to field will allow you to narrow the Assignment group down to only groups that they are associated with. User Communication List and Work Notes List – Adding yourself to either of these sections allows you to receive notifications when there are updates added to the User Communication or Work Notes fields.  Click the  icon to add yourself. Quantity – The Quantity default is 1.  If the Incident relates to performing the same work on multiple items, change the quantity accordingly.  For example, you may have a request to configure three new Windows laptops.  You may use one Incident to track all three. Short Description (Required) – Type a brief description of the issue in the Short Description field.  As you begin typing Knowledge Base suggestions will populate below the field based on your description of the Incident.  These can be used as resources to potentially help you resolve your Incident without needing to open a ticket.  Clicking Attach will add the Knowledge Base article to the User communication field. The  icon to the right of the Short Description field allows you to open a popup window which allows you to search Knowledge Base articles. User Communication - Type any comments you would like the customers to see in the User Communication field. An email will be sent to the Caller with the information entered into the User Communication field. Work Notes – Include complete details about the Incident in the Work Notes field, along with all troubleshooting steps you may have taken (avoid using the Description field as the information entered into it can be changed at any time).  Work Notes are only visible to ITIL Users and not the Caller. Attachments – You may add an attachment to an Incident by clicking the paperclip icon in the upper right.  In the Attachments window, browse and select the desired attachment, then click Attach.  Close the Attachments window. Submit – To save the Incident, click Submit (upper right or lower left).  A list of all incidents will display. To create a new Incident, click New. Sensitive Electronic Information (SEI) – Please refer to KB0019335 for a thorough explanation of what information can and cannot be added to the SEI field.  Before you can add SEI to an Incident you must first save it (Submit).  Once the Incident has been saved, click the Sensitive Electronic Information tab and enter your information in the field.  The information you enter is only visible to the Creation Group and Assignment Group.  If you are not on the Duke network, you will not be able to view sensitive information; connect to the VPN to gain access. IMPORTANT! – Do not enter Sensitive Electronic Information into any other field in the system. Using Templates Support@Duke supports the use of templates for Incidents, allowing you to quickly create Incidents for issues that you frequently encounter.  To view available templates for your group right-click on the incident banner and select Templates > Apply Templates.  A list of templates for your group will display; select the desired template. You may also create templates for your own use.  To create a new template, do the following: Right-click on the Incident banner and select Templates > Edit Templates In the Templates window, click New (upper left). In the Name field, type a name for the template. In the Short Description field, type a description. Set the Owning Group so that it can be shared with others in your group Set the Service Provider To set values for other fields click Choose Field to select the desired fields.  Repeat this step until you have all the fields needed for your template. Click Submit. Escalations Escalations and notifications to management only occur when the Incident State is New.  When reassigning an Incident to another group, set Incident State back to New. To stop escalations, change the Incident State to Active
prompt: Whenever the Incident State or Priority is updated, an entry in the Work Notes field is required., completion:  You can assign a ticket to yourself by typing your name in the Assigned To field. Working on an Incident The following sections provide detail on how to manage tickets that are assigned to you or your group. Viewing Incidents Assigned to You or Your Group To view Incidents assigned to you click My Work in the Application Navigator, under Service Desk. To view Incidents assigned to your group, click My Groups’ Work. In the list of displayed Incidents, click the Incident number to display the Incident’s details. Assigning the Incident to Yourself If you wish to accept responsibility for managing an Incident, change the Incident state to Active and in the Assigned To field, enter your name.  Save the ticket by clicking Update. Sending Updates to Customers There are two ways to send information to a customer regarding their Incident: Compose an email – In the banner click the envelope icon.  An email window opens.  You may include additional email addresses and attach a file, if desired. Add notes to the User Communication field – Unlike the Work notes, this field is visible to the customer.  When the Incident is updated, any information entered into User Communication will be sent via email to the caller.  Use this field to keep the caller informed about progress on the incident. Viewing Activity All activity related to an Incident can be viewed near the bottom of the Incident window, below the Work Notes field.  This information can be filtered by clicking the funnel icon located in the upper right of the list of Activities. Converting an Incident to a Generic Request Clicking the Convert button in the upper right-hand corner of the Incident window will allow you to convert an Incident to a Generic Request. This will take you to a new window that displays the new ticket along with the converted Task number. This new Task will have to have the following required fields filled out: Subcategory and Legacy CI. Copying an Incident If a copy of an Incident needs to be made then click the Copy Incident button in the upper right hand corner.  The new, copied Incident will open in a new window and will need to have any required fields completed for it to be submitted. Resolving Incidents Either select Resolved from the Incident State field or click on the Resolve Incident button at the top of the form. Choose Update to save. Searching for Incidents There are multiple ways to search for Incidents in Support@Duke.  Two of them are described below: In the left navigation, under Service Desk, select Incidents.  All Incidents in the system will be displayed.  You may sort the results by any column by right-clicking on the column name and choosing how you want to sort. To narrow the search, in the Go to list (in the Incidents list header), select the desired field.  In the blank box, enter the search value and press Enter. The Incident's ticket number can also be entered into the Search field in the upper right-hand corner of the Support@Duke window; this will take you directly to the ticket. Note: To search for a value that appears anywhere in an Incident, precede the search term with an asterisk. Changes to IT Service, Application or Closure Codes Open a Support@Duke request for any changes, additions or deletions that need to be made to IT Services, Applications or Closure Codes and set the Assignment Group to Service Management-OIT. Duke Health Users:  To view updated support documentation for Incident and Request processes that are specific to Duke Health, please visit the DHTS User Portal University Users:   Please visit the attachment to view the Support@Duke Request Fulfillment Guide for End Users.   This guide explains how to enter and manage your requests and incidents. To be used by non ITIL role (End Users) Abstract: This document is a reference guide for end users with a non-ITIL Role in Support@Duke on how to process generic and password reset service requests. Logging into Support@Duke University users should log in to Support@Duke with NetID and Password. Duke Health users should use the DHTS User Portal.University users can locate the Service Request Catalog in the Self-Service section of the left Navigation panel: Duke Health users should click on the Get IT section: and then Featured Requests: A Service Request is typically a request for information, or advice, or for a small change or for access to a service or application. Examples are password resets, software installation on a laptop, or a request to move, add, or change a telephone line/number. In Support@Duke Service Requests are handled very similarly to the way orders are handled at Amazon.com. The two parts to the Service Request in Support@Duke that will be important for you to know as a customer/end-user are: The Request itself, and The Request Item (often referred to as RITM). The user fills out the request form, and for generic service requests there is a one to one to one relationship between the Request and the Requested Item.

TEM stands for IBM's Tivoli Endpoint Manager.  Prior to being acquired by IBM, the product was known as BigFix and has been used in the School of Medicine since 2003. TEM is a software system used by Desktop and Server Support groups within Duke Medicine to maintain and deploy software packages, security patches and configurations on managed Computers, also called Endpoints. The Vendor, IBM, has renamed the product.  It is now referred to as IBM Endpoint Manager (IEM).  This was done to minimize confusion with another product of theirs, Tivoli Endpoint. IBM is phasing out the use of the Tivoli brand for many of their software products.  As a result, TEM is now referred to as IBM BigFix. · What does IEM/IBM BigFix do for me as an End User? It ensures that your computer is kept properly patched and secure. It ensures that the computer you are using in kept in compliance with Duke Medicine Polices and related Federal and State Regulations dealing with secure handling of Sensitive Electronic Information (SEI which includes more than just PHI). · Who uses IEM/BigFix? Designated individuals in each Desktop and Server Support group within Duke Medicine use IEM Console software to deploy software packages, OS patches and configuration settings to managed computers in an effort to comply with Duke Medicine Policies. · There is a new icon in my system Tray labeled "Click to open IBM BigFix Support Center". What is it for? The IEM Client UI is an optional piece of IEM that can be enabled at the discretion of each Desktop and Server Support group The icon you see is the User Interface for IEM.  It allows users to have some say in how software patches and settings are installed on the computer you are using. Presentation of the UI is controlled by the Desktop and Server Support staff member that deployed the action. They can choose to make some changes silently, in the background. If you have further questions, please contact your Desktop and Server Support group for assistance. The IEM Client UI has can have several tabs displayed at the discretion of the Desktop and Server Support group.  One of the Tabs may be labeled Dashboard, and will display a variety of information about the computer. Some of this information may be useful when contacting the Service Desk or a Desktop and Server Support group for assistance. One of the Tabs may present you with "Offers" for software installations that might be appropriate to your role within Duke Medicine.  Each "Offer" would have been authorized and deployed by the Desktop and Server Support group responsible for the computer in question and any questions about the offers or software should be referred back to them. · A dialog box popped up with the title "IBM BigFix Support Center". What is it? See "There is a new icon in my system Tray…". It is possible for an IEM Console operator to make use of the ClientUI without the icon showing itself in the System Tray, on a per Action basis. · What are Offers in IEM? An Offer in IEM is an Action deployed by a Console operator that is not 'mandatory', but can be deployed at the discretion of the end user. These may include optional software packages, computer settings or configurations. · Why does Duke Policy require IEM be installed on all computers on the Duke Medicine networks? As a Healthcare Entity, Duke Medicine is required to obey any and all Federal and State Regulations concerning the secure handling of Patient Information (HIPAA/HITEC/etc). Specifically, several Federal and State regulations require that any computers used to process or manage Patient Information be patched with any/all applicable software patches from the publisher of the software, and that a record be kept of this patching status, along with any documentation regarding why a particular patch might not be installed. ·         How do I get IEM installed on my computer?

Some of you will have the ability to document patient allergies if you have clinical credentials and you see patients in standard of care visits. In a standard of care visit, clinicians will ALWAYS click Mark as Reviewed button to indicate they have verified the patient's allergy list is correct. This fulfills Meaningful Use requirements. But our research visits do not count towards Meaningful Use. If you don't click the Mark as Reviewed button, it won't hurt Duke's eligibility for incentive payments. And what if you do click it? If you click Mark as Reviewed, then your name and today's date appear, indicating that the patient's list of allergies are correct as of this time. * The general rule is to continue doing in Maestro Care whatever you currently do now. If you typically sign off on allergy review, click Mark as Reviewed for your patients. If you don't want your name associated with allergy review in the patient's chart, then you don't have to click it in a research visit Corresponding video here.

Prior to the First Visit: Associating Orders to a Research Study The orders we will sign will either automatically release based on the expected time of the delivered order or will have to be manually released which we will discuss later. In any event, each order involved in a study needs to be associated with a particular study so the charges involved will get routed to the appropriate responsible party. To associate an order to a research study click the Research Association button. Select the appropriate study by clicking each box in the grid or to associate all orders to one study simply click the title heading of the study.

In a Research Visit, the chief complaint should always be "research".TIP: After you enter the chief complaint, right-click "Research" to add as a speed button.Corresponding video here. Prior to the First Visit: Creating Orders Only Encounter You can order labs, imaging test, and research medications in advance to be completed prior to a visit to the provider or coordinator using an orders-only encounter.  With an orders-only encounter, if the patient does not keep his or her scheduled appointment, the signed order will be available whenever the patient arrives.  It allows the CRC to place orders on a patient without having to open up the patient's chart and create an unnecessary encounter.Here, you'll learn how to create encounters "on the fly" so that you can accomplish tasks that are not associated with a patient visit.  When using Maestro Care, you may need to place orders or create documentation when there is no appointment for a patient.  You may have seen the patient in the past and now have the need to write a progress note about the patient's progress.  Or, you may need to write orders, but there is not an appointment to work within.  To deal with these situations, you can create certain types of encounters.  For example, to add documentation to a patient's chart, you can create a documentation encounter.  To writer orders, you can create an orders only encounter.  Let's do that now.Click on the encounter button on the top toolbar:Type the patient's name or MRN and click Find Patient.  Select the appropriate patient and click Accept.In the Provider field, enter the name of the Principal Investigator (PI) on your tent card.For the type, choose "orders only".  Select the correct department and click acceptAn Orders only encounter is created and the Research Navigator opens.  You now have access to your order sets (Smart Sets) which will allow you to place the necessary orders on your patient in advance of their scheduled arrival.  This gives time for the orders to be second-signed (non licensed CRC) and ready when Harold arrives for his appointment.  We will now discuss how to enter and manage orders.Prior to the Visit: Using Smart Sets to Place OrdersA Smart Set allows you to accomplish several tasks with just a few clicks on a single form, including ordering medications and procedures, documenting immunizations, entering diagnoses and levels of service, and providing disposition and follow up information. The Smart Sets in Clinical Research are essentially order sets based on the individual protocol.  It allows a CRC to pick which orders the study will pay for, a given time based on the calendar and established billing protocols.  It is a special type of order set which defines and establishes orders based on the medical protocols and patient timeline.Upon creating an orders only encounter, the Research Navigator should open automatically as the default.  You can also open up the Research Navigator simply by double clicking the name of a patient on your schedule.Click on Smart Sets in the table of contents.  In the search box, type in the protocol number (PROXXXXX).Make sure the selected box is checked and click on "Open Order Set"(If a pop-up window appears, simply select "continue".)From here we can open up and expand each section and click in the box of the order you would like to order.You will notice several things: Orders needing a second signature will be indicated (non-licensed CRC's ONLY) A Purple square  indicates this is a future order The blue summary sentence when clicked, will allow you to modify details regarding the order.  It includes the expected and starting dates when applicable. You also have the option to add an order not included on the protocol-driven Smart Set using the "add order" button.  If it is unrelated to the study, we will not link that order to the study.  For instance, if a patient stated he or she did not have their flu shot and wanted to receive it, an order for the vaccine could be placed via the "add order" button.  As long as we do not link it to the study, it will get routed to the proper billing party (i.e., insurance).

Patient Lists The Patient List Activity is made up My Lists and Available Lists.  My Lists contains two types of lists: User specific (My Patients) and Shared Patient Lists. They have similar functions within the Patient Lists activity. Clinicians use both types of lists to track specific patients and can maintain the lists themselves, by adding and removing columns and patients. The main difference between these two types of lists is that a My List is used by a single clinician, while shared patient lists are viewed and maintained by multiple clinicians. Users can create or modify user made My Lists. All users upon first logging in will have one My List generated automatically titled “My Patients”.  Nursing staff will have two lists automatically generated titled “My Patients” and “My Unit”.  Users can created additional My Lists. Available Lists contain system lists that are used to access inpatient facility lists, unit census, consult lists, and discharge lists. All types’ of users use patient lists- mainly inpatient with some outpatient users. Service Now Priority:  Issues/ questions with My Lists are NEVER critical or high, as clinicians can access the system unit lists to find patients. Patient Lists Common Questions: Question #1: Deleting a patient list I accidentally deleted the "My Patients" list under the My Lists section. The system even alerted me, "Are you sure you want to delete 'My Patients'? This action cannot be undone. Your list will be permanently deleted. Now I regret doing that. How can I restore it? Answer Thankfully, there are two ways to bring the My Patients list back to the My Lists section. 1. Note: This option only works if you do not have any personal folders. For example, if you only had a My Patients and a My Unit folder before and now only have a My Unit folder, this will work for you. However, if you had a My Patients, My Unit, and Joe’s Patients, this will not work for you. a. If you still have a My Unit folder, right-click on the folder, and choose Delete My List. (If you do not have any folder under My Lists, continue to step 3.) Deleting the other list will reset both lists. b. You will be asked, “Are you sure you want to delete…” Choose Delete.                       c. Log out of Maestro Care and log back in. d. Your My Patients (and My Unit, if applicable) will be restored. 2. If you have other folders within your My Lists section, you will have to create a new folder. a. Click the little triangle next to the Edit List button and select Create My List b. A New List screen appears. In the Name: field, type My Patients and click Copy...                       c. A Choose Columns screen appears. In the Use a Template field scroll and find the template appropriate to the user and list, and click accept.  For example: ++INPATIENT NURSE TEMPLATE-MY PATIENTS ++INPATIENT NURSE TEMPLATE-MY UNIT ++INPATIENT PHYSICIAN CONSULT TEMPLATE DUHS IP PHYSICIAN MY LIST TEMPLATE d. Review if additional columns are needed and click Accept when done. e. The My Patients list appears under My Lists. f. Under Available Lists, click System Lists > Patient Lists to see all available patient lists. Click-and-drag All My Patients to My Patients. When you see a plus sign below the mouse arrow, release the click. g. After adding, the system list is viewable in the My Patients list Question #2 I already have a folder, how do I change the folder I created under My Lists? You can rename your My Lists folders and add/delete/rearrange the columns within your folder. 1. Right-click on your folder within My Lists. Choose Properties. 2. When you’re done, click Accept on the bottom right. Question #3 Why is this patient on my list?
prompt: Why is a My Lists showing these patients specifically?, completion:  My Lists can show system lists which are dynamically updated lists managed by Epic (two stick figure icon) AND contain patients manually added to them by the end user (one stick figure icon). To see what is included in this folder, click the triangle to open it. A single stick figure icon means the patient was manually added. If that patient should no longer be on the list, right-click on the patient and choose Remove Patient. Click Remove when prompted. Question #4:  Why can I not update this shared list? 1. The owner of the shared list has not given you access to add/remove patients or 2. The owner has not given you permission to add users to the list. *** For either scenario, the clinician will need to contact the owner of the shared list to update the access provided.  As an owner of the list, there should ALWAYS be more than one person who has complete access to the list to add/ remove users.  This will eliminate list issues if the owner leaves the system, and no one can update the list after the owner is gone*** Additional Information: Or submit a non-urgent incident ticket via the Duke Health IT Portal at https://dhts.duke.edu OVERVIEW At the core of our Real Time Locating System (RTLS) is the Centrak hardware infrastructure.  Hospital staff can use basic visibility to locate key equipment or staff. This eliminates either phone calls to find specific people or time searching for pieces of equipment. A single floor of the hospital has thousands of moving parts, and real-time visibility can bring order and comprehension to a chaotic environment.​ The RTLS Cetani Portal is a part of the web-based enterprise web system, users can see this information on computers, mobile phones, and tablets in real-time. Real-time means that across many devices and device types, updates occur in less than a second.

prompt: How can I change an appointment status from "No Show" to "Canceled"?, completion:  Details A patient did not show up for an appointment and the system automatically marked the appointment as "No Show." The patient noticed this in MyChart and is asking to have the appointment status changed because the patient was admitted to the hospital. The clinic charges patients if there have been three "No Show" appointments and the patient does not want these counted in that rule. Clinic staff count the "No Show" appointments using the table of appointments in the Appt Desk activity tab. Go to the appointment desk and pull up the patient.

Symptom/Question There is a message in My Open Charts In Basket folder stating I have an encounter that needs to be closed. It was open by mistake. I would like to delete an encounter that was open by mistake, how can I do that? Incorrect information entered to encounter, what can I do with the encounter? If patient DOES NOT show for an appointment and an encounter has NOT been opened yet, the appointment status will be updated to No Show after End Of Day processign runs (72 hours). If an ENCOUNTER HAS BEEN OPENED prior to patient arrival and patient DOES NOT ARRIVE, use the No Show Encounter SmartSet to close.  This will also convert the encounter to a No Show encounter. If a provider or nurse ACCIDENTALLY OPENS AN ENCOUNTER or DOCUMENTS UNDER WRONG PATIENT... Providers can use the Erroneous Encounter Smart Set Nurses who accidentally open encounters can complete the necessary fields and send the encounter to the provider to close it if it is an Office Visit encounter. Nurses cannot close Office Visit encounters. Using Patient Station, search for and open the encounter in question. Click SmartSets under the the Visit Navigator activity tab. Search for and open "No Show" or "Erroneous Encounter" SmartSet and hit Enter.All required sections are automatically populated with preselected values. Click Sign to sign the SmartSet.

KB0015954 Question/Problem:  The user states vital signs are not coming into their anesthesia record. ***Once a device has been disconnected from patient, there is no way to 'recover' them and back-fill into a previous patient record. The only way to actively troubleshoot issues such as these are when the patient is connected to the monitor and attached in the intraop workspace*** ***If the patient is still connected to the device and they are requesting for "vital signs" to be resent please send ticket to the Specialty Clinical-DHTS* The current version of iSirona no longer supports re-sending of device messages from a connected device into the MaestroCare record. Answer:  Possible causes include: Device Connect USB dongle not securely attached and sending data (as indicated by BLUE blinking light on the dongle every 30 seconds). Device is not properly associated with the workstation.  Users can manually associate cases independently. Hot-swapping certain modules on the anesthesia machine/monitor rack can cause iSirona to STOP sending data/messages - SOLUTION is to have user unplug the rack for about 15 seconds, then plug back in again. iSirona (vitals sign interface) experiences a downtime. Resolution: Has the user manually reattached the device? Has the user rebooted? If the user has completed the bullet points above; see steps below: 1.  Ask user to go to Intraprocedure Activity—click on the Device button—click on the device name 2.  If you do not see any VS info then send to Specialty Clinical-DHTS 3.  If you see VS displaying that are not in yellow, the auto validation has stopped.  (Steps A-G below) A.  Have the user validate all of the VS manually (IMPORTANT:  may have to scroll back; only the VS displaying in the window will be validated) B.  If the user does not know how to validate the VS manually, please see attached word document. C.  Once all of the VS have been validated by user; have the user take note of the device name. D.  Detach the device by clicking the X on the bottom left.  **IMPORTANT:  if the user does not validate the VS prior to detaching the device, the VS information will be lost** E.  Have the user search for the device to reattach by typing the name and then clicking Search All F.  To attach the device, have the user click Add on the bottom right of the Device Management window. G.  The VS should begin to auto-validate for the user. 4.  If there is SOME information coming into the record or if there are only SOME parameters coming into the record, ensure that there is not MORE THAN ONE device connected to the record.  This occasionally happens when a device is (auto) connected in an OR Induction room and never stopped - then moving the patient into the OR and (auto) connecting the device there.  Competing "Respiratory Rate" or "Pulse Oxymetry" parameters will not come into the record as desired.  Here's how to manually disconnect a device: Additional Information:  If the Vital Signs do not begin to auto validate, send ticket to Maestro Care-Optime Anesthesia-DHTS For additional help, please contact the Duke Medicine Service Desk at (919) 684-2243, or from Self-Service in the left navigation bar; click Service Catalog to access the Can We Help You? section.

Core Clinical Applications-DHTS supports OBIX. Maestro Care Stork supports MC-Stork. Clinical Engineering supports the fetal monitor. Cross Reference KB: KB0015823 OBIX: How To Perform OBIX Fetal Monitoring For Triplets OBIX system data collection can only accommodate two fetus per bed.  Duke Birthing Center has wired the following rooms for two fetal monitors to capture the data for the third fetus: a. In Triage Unit 5400: rm5424, rm5425, rm5426 b. In Labor & Delivery Unit 5700: rm5702, rm5703,rm5704, rm5717 To Merge Records: Once the patient has delivered, the triplet fetal monitor records must be merged with the patient primary record. The Edit command can be used to correct data entry errors by renaming the duplicate records and merging them into a single patient record with multiple encounters (traces). 1.   From within OBIX, search for the patient. Click Patients-->Search 2. The Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Medical Record Number, and Date of Birth must be exactly the same for the OBIX system to merge two records under one patient name. See example below. The duplicate records are Nelson, Norma and Nelson, Norma Fetus C. 3. Select the duplicate record (Nelson, Norma Fetus C.) by highlighting it and then click the Select button. From the menu bar, Click Patients --> Edit to edit the incorrect record to make it match the correct record. 4. Click OK to save the changes. 5. Doing this merges the two records into a single patient record with several encounters (or visits). The next time a user selects the patient in the OBIX system and reviews her traces; several encounters will be available for selection. NOTE ABOUT DISCHARGED INCORRECT RECORDS: If the patient record you're trying to merge had been discharged, you'll get the following error: If you get this error, you'll need to cancel the discharge.  This is to to be done after the appropriate patient's correct encounter in OBIX has been discharged. To cancel the discharge: Make the incorrect record your Active patient by going to Patients > Search and selecting the appropriate patient after searching for them. From the ADT Menu, select Cancel Discharge: Modify the incorrect record to match the correct record/Maestro Discharge the patient again using ADT > Discharge: For additional assistance please use the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu) via GET IT to submit a Request, FIX IT to report a Problem, or Chat with the Service Desk.

Email that meets the criteria defined in your Junk E-Mail settings in OWA will be automatically placed in your Junk E-Mail folder instead of in your Inbox. OWA provides tools that allow you to re-classify messages that have incorrectly been identified as “junk”, or messages that should be considered junk, but did not meet the criteria that was defined at the time the message was received.
prompt: When new mail is received, it is checked against your Junk E-Mail filters before it is placed in your Inbox. If it is considered to be unwanted and unsolicited email based on the criteria currently defined in your Junk E-Mail settings, it will be placed in the “Junk E-mail” folder in your folder list instead of your Inbox.The messages opened from your Junk E-Mail folder will have most of the same functions available that can be used with emails in your Inbox., completion:  NOTE:  The information in this article includes screen shots and directions taken from the latest version of Office 365. Please be aware that Microsoft can and does update the OWA client frequently and the directions and screen shots below may no longer match what you see in Office 365. Please notify the Service Desk or update this article with a comment below if the information is no longer accurate and cannot be followed reliably. To correct the incorrect classification of a message as Junk Mail: Go to the Junk E-mail folder and locate the message that should not be flagged as "junk mail". Right click and select the option Mark as not junk. OPTIONALLY: Click the Report or Don't report buttons to send your choice to Microsoft so the accuracy of junk mail reporting can be improved. To change the rules that are used to determine what messages are flagged as “junk” from OWA: Verify you are using the Mail view (not Calendar, People, etc.). Select the gear icon near the upper, right-hand corner, then Options. Select Mail -> Accounts -> Block or allow. If you are having issues with inaccurate junk mail reporting, you may want to select Don't move email to my Junk Email folder. Otherwise, verify that the sender has been added to your Safe Senders and Recipients list. You can also manually add other addresses by entering the address and clicking the plus sign. Change the settings as desired , then click the Save button near the bottom-left corner.

Cause:         From google searches, this seems to be where a print job was sent to the printer that was malformed and so the printer gets into this bad state. The main task is to try and identify the source of the bad job.   You cannot assume that when someone calls in saying they are not able to print as that application being the source.   We have found, in some cases, where a Mac notebook was sending a document to the printer and that was the source of the corruption. The method so far to clear this error message is to turn the printer off and then back on again.   Unfortunately,  the workstation that sent the bad job may just re-send it again when it comes back online. Issues: Due to the fact that users are allowed to print directly to a printer via the IP address, it is very difficult to determine who is the source of the print job.  Until the source is removed, the problem will remain.    Swapping out the printer has been attempted in the past but it does not work as the source of the bad print job would just send the job again to the replacement printer. Question: When I send email from my Duke Office 365 account, the email is sent from a different email address than the one I expect.  What's happening?Answer: When you send mail from your Duke Office 365 account, the mail is always sent as your "primary SMTP address".  For Duke University customers, that is usually the same thing as your preferred email address.If you are a student and use your netid@duke.edu in correspondence, you will find that your primary SMTP address is set to your alias (e.g., firstname.lastname@duke.edu). This cannot be changed. You will still be able to receive email sent to your netid@duke.edu, but in sending email, you will find that your email comes from your alias address. If you are with Duke Health, your outgoing mail will either be your firstname.lastname@duke.edu (your fullname alias) or your firstname.lastname@dm.duke.edu (derived from your fullname alias).  This cannot be changed without changing your fullname alias. To check your preferred email address: Visit the Duke Account Self-Service page: http://duke.edu/online.  Log in with your NetID and NetID password. Look for "Your Directory Listing".  In this section, find "Preferred email address".  Your preferred email address is displayed here. To change your preferred email address (if you are not a student, or not part of Duke Health): Click "Manage Directory Listings".  This section expands. Click "Change your preferred email address".  This section expands. One or more email addresses appear.  Your current preferred email address has a radio button selecting it. To choose one of your other email addresses, click the button next to that address.  Or, you can type a new address here and press "Add new address".  PLEASE NOTE that this is only a way of choosing which of your existing addresses should be published in the directory and associated with your outgoing mail; it cannot be used to create a new email address.  To change your Duke fullname alias, choose the "Change your full name alias" option instead. Changes to the preferred email address will take some time to take effect. Resetting McKesson Electronic Verification of Authorship (EVA) Password Users MUST create and/or reset their own EVA passwords.  The Service Desk has the capability of resetting the EVA password to nothing (see steps 1-7) but should reinforce to users that they should do this for themselves!  A Word document with the  instructions below and screen prints are attached and you can email these to the end user if necessary. An authentication password within McKesson HHC is used for completing/locking orders, visits, and documents, as well as for batching out and completing shift documentation.  To reset an EVA password, the user should: Select Tools --> Change EVA Password from the MAIN McKesson menu (NOT from the Clinical Explorer or IPU Explorer menu!).  The Electronic Verification of Authorship window appears. Select Reset An Authorship Password To Nothing. Click the OK button.  The Reset For Which Personnel window appears. Search for the employee’s last name in the PreFilter field and click Apply. Highlight the correct employee and click the OK.  Change EVA Password confirmation window appears. Click the Yes button. A message appears confirming that the password was reset. Click the OK button.  You have now set the password to nothing. Since this employee password was reset to “No Password”, the first time this employee completes a document protected by EVA, the program will prompt for a password.  Employee should open the document/order that they need to sign.  When they attempt to complete/sign that will see the Specify an EVA password window. Type a new password in the EVA Password field and click OK. Re-type this same new password in the New Password and the Verify New Password fields and click Set.  You have now set your EVA password. You must now re-type the same new password once more to sign your order or document.  Type the password again and click OK. This article is not active. See the attached document with step-by-step instructions for resetting a password in Homecare360/HomecareNet. New passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters. Isilon (duhsnas-pri): How to recover recently deleted files. This process will ONLY work for restores on the Isilon storage system. Question A user has deleted files from their home drive or departmental share, how do they recover them? While logged into your workstation, navigate to the location of the deleted files. Right-click the Folder from where the files were recently saved and select Properties. Click to select the Previous Versions tab. Review the Folder versions to locate the date and time closest to when you think the file or folder was deleted. Highlight by selecting the file or folder and click the appropriate button (Open, Copy, or Restore). TIP: If you are unsure and do not want to overwrite any other existing files in the directory, choose to Copy the data instead of Restore. Restoring will overwrite any of the files with the same name. If copying, choose a temporary location on your workstation to identify which files and folders are needed. Additional Information This process will ONLY work for restores on the Isilon storage system. This can be determined by looking at the mapping of the drive.  If it begins with \\duhsnas-pri, it is on the Isilon.  An example is shown below.

prompt: How do I request a change in File Manager access in the Safety Reporting System?, completion:  Please Note File Manager accounts are limited to those individuals who have been identified by their entity to participate in the safety reporting review process. File Manager accounts are limited to authorized individuals as defined in the DUHS Safety Reporting Policy. Individuals cannot request their own File Manager account access. The manager, safety officer or quality manager for the organization should make a request for an employee to become a file manager using the Service Now Service Request Catalog Item, "Account Access Order Guide - Maestro Care, Clinical & Business Applications".  Please see the attached document for detailed instructions on how to make an RL6 File Manager account request via the Service Now Catalog Item.  Account requests submitted through the Service Catalog are fulfilled by the Account Management-DHTS Team with assistance from the Specialty Clinical-DHTS Team as necessary. UUThere are multiple circumstances where a YubiKey may cease to be used by one individual, and need to be transferred to another. In these cases, the YubiKey must first be deactivated, so as to remove its affiliation from the person to whom the device was initially registered. Below are the steps to deactivate a YubiKey. Step 1) Have the user log into their Multi-Factor Authentication page from https://idms-mfa.oit.duke.edu/mfa/home. The user will first have to go through their normal Duke login screen if they are not already logged into a Duke system. Step 2) From the 'Manage Devices' menu items on the right, click to expand 'Advanced Options. Step 3) From the 'Advanced Options' submenu, click the link for the current YubiKey token number. Step 4) From the 'Update your hardware token' page, select 'Delete token.' This will remove the YubiKey's affiliation from its former owner, and allow the device to be passed to the next person for reactivation. PDN: University Connecting to a file share over VPN First you will need to install the Duke VPN client if you have not already done so, the client can be installed from: https://portal.duke.edu/ Once you have the VPN software installed click on connect. You should then be able to choose the “Protected_Data” connection under the Group dropdown, type in your netid and password.  The “Second Password” field is used for Duke’s multi-factor login service.  In the “Second Password” field you have several options for authentication depending on your preference. To send an access request notification to your smartphone type: push. To have the application call one of your pre-configured phone numbers type: phone.  (or phone1, phone2, etc.) You may enter the six digit code generated by the Duo Mobile application on your cell phone. You may press the button on your YubiKey to have it enter a code. Once your VPN software is connected to the “Protected_Data” VPN you will need to connect to or map your share. Mapping to a share (Windows): Click on the start button on the lower left of the screen On the open menu click “computer” Once the explorer windows for “computer” opens up click on “Map a network Drive” on the upper bar. The “Map Network Drive” will present you with selecting a drive letter, a folder to map to, and reconnection Drive letter: your choice, but there might be a project specific letter that is preferred Folder: type \\secure-nas-fe01.oit.duke.edu\<YOUR SHARE NAME> (where <YOUR SHARE NAME>=the name of the network share assigned to your group). Reconnect: Click “Reconnect at logon” to make the computer reconnect the next time you login Click Finished. You should now have a mapped drive to the share. You can check it by going back to “computer” and looking for your drive. Mapping to a share (Mac): Go to Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server In the server address bar type in smb://secure-nas-fe01.oit.duke.edu/<YOUR_SHARE_NAME> and click the Connect button. You will be prompted to select the volumes you want to mount.  Select the share associated with your group and click the OK button. You should now have the share mounted on your system. Connecting to a VM over RDP (from campus) First you will need to configure your Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP) Client. (For Macs): Install the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Mac App Store. Start the Remote Desktop client and click New to create a new connection. Use the information in 1b and 4 below to configure the connection. From your start menu (in Windows), select “remote desktop connection” The first time that you use this protocol, you will have to change your remote desktop gateway.  To do this, select the “show options” menu and then select the Advanced tab.  Select “settings” and “use these RD Gateway server settings” The gateway server name is :  oit-srdsgw-pap1.win.duke.edu Hit Okay and return to the “general” tab.  From the connection settings on the general tab, hit save. From your start menu (in Windows), select “remote desktop connection” From the remote desktop login, select the path to your VM (e.g., <PROJECTNAME>-pap1.win.duke.edu).  Then select “connect” Next, a RD gateway server credential menu will ask for your credentials (username and password). Username = WIN\NetID Password = NetID password You will then see a screen with an icon for “Other User”- select it.  You will be prompted to enter your username (NetID) and password (associated with the NetID). The Duo security menu will prompt you to enter a second factor – you can enter the 6 digit number provided by the Duo app, or push for a message to your phone.  Once you provide an authentication, you are entered into the protected desktop space. Connecting to a VM over SSH (from campus) 1.  Using your SSH client of choice, connect to pn-jump-01.oit.duke.edu (or pn-jump-ssri-01.oit.duke.edu for SSRI users), and authenticate with your netID and second factor.2.  From that "jump" box, connect to your protected network VM via SSH, see example below. Connecting to a VM over RDP or SSH (from off-campus) First you will need to install the Duke VPN client if you have not already done so, the client can be installed from: https://portal.duke.edu/ You should then be able to choose the “Protected_Data” connection under the Group dropdown, type in your netid and password then press OK. Once your VPN software is connected to the “Protected_Data” VPN, you can connect via RDP or SSH using the (appropriate) steps outlined above. **NOTE** For SSH connections via the VPN, you can connect directly to your VM, rather than doing so via the "jump" box; that is, do step 1 above, but connect directly to the host appropriate for step 2. Information on Duke’s multi factor service and how to enroll may be found by going to https://oit.duke.edu/mfa. If you have questions about the change and how it will affect you, please contact your local IT support or the Duke security office at security@duke.edu Question: I "lost" my activities bar when I have a patient chart opened. I can't chart!? Answer: The user has inadvertantly clicked the 'resize' button that hides the activity bar.
prompt: What they see when they have clicked 'Resize' button., completion:  Stated Issue: Many times end users will claim their "access has changed", they "can't chart", or they “can’t bill”. Their view, navigators, or activities have changed. “I do not have the correct activities to do my job”; or “I have the incorrect charge capture” (providers). “I am a provider and it is asking me for an authorizing provider when I enter orders”. Affected users will include: Physicians, NP’s, PA’s, Nurses, NP Students, Med & PA Students, HUC’s, NA/Nursing students, Therapists (ex. Respiratory, Physical, or Occupational), & Ancillary users (ex. Case Managers or Dietary) Answer: Many of these cases revolve around the users not logging into the correct department in Epic. The log in department the user selects drives many of the activities and tools a user will see once they log into Epic and open a patient chart. Providers logged into a nursing unit will not be able to enter orders without providing an authorizing provider or have the correct charges in Charge Capture. Have the caller verify they are logging into the correct department to perform their job duties. The log in department is located in the upper left corner of their screen. Nurses, Nursing Assistants, and HUC’s log into the nursing unit they are working on. Physicians log into their clinic, if they have one, or a Physician IP Virtual Department in order to get the correct tools and Charge Capture options. Nursing Students log into the DUHS DUAL ROLE NURSING STUDENT VIRTUAL department Nurse / Nurse practitioner student:
prompt: When the user is acting as a NP Student, they log into ‘NP Student’ department, completion:  NA / Nursing Student or HUC / Nursing Student:
prompt: When the user is acting as a Nursing student, they log into the DUHS DUAL ROLE NURSING STUDENT VIRTUAL department, completion:  Physician Assistants Students and Medical Students log into their specialty virtual department Ancillary User Groups Log into virtual departments, not actual patient care units. There is typical a virtual department created per hospital. Examples include: DUH (DRH or DRAH) PHYSICAL THERAPY VIRTUAL DUH (DRH or DRAH) OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY VIRTUAL DUH (DRH or DRAH) CASE MANAGEMENT VIRTUAL DUH (DRH or DRAH) SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY VIRTUAL Clinical Social Work logs into <Hospital> Clinical Social Work Virtual or any of the Transplant departments for Inpatients Standard tools from within a patient chart Nursing (nurse, nurse manager, nurse assistant, unit clerk) user types all log into the patient care unit or nursing unit. Ex: Standard nurse tools Ancillaries and Therapies (ex. Respiratory, Physical, Occupational, Speech, Case Managers, and Dietary) users log into hospital specific virtual departments. Ex: Physical Therapist tools Ex: Case manager Providers, including Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants, users should log into their clinic if they have one. The providers who only work inpatient (hospitalists) need to log into inpatient provider virtual departments. The clinic or virtual department login department will provide the provider the tools they need for signing orders and charge capture. There are many virtual departments that are specialty specific. If there is not a specialty virtual department for the user, the IP GENERAL MEDICINE VIRTUAL department will work for any provider After installing, from Start > ArcGIS > ArcGIS Administrator > Desktop, enter the server info gislicense.nicholas.duke.edu in the field on the right, choosing Advanced (ArcInfo) Concurrent Use license type.
prompt: How to recover items that are missing from your mailbox, completion:  There are a variety of reasons why you may need to put something back into your mailbox: You are cleaning out a folder or your Inbox and delete something you need to retrieve. You look in your email client and realize items such as messages or other items are missing and you have no knowledge of removing the content. You are missing almost all your email and you have no idea how this happened. This document gives you the information you need to recover your messages and identify how the email was deleted and prevent it from happening again. We wil start with mail recovery. Getting the mail back The process for recovering email over the years has been difficult and time-consuming and your IT support person may have used phrases such as "recover from tape" or "submit a ticket requesting email be restored". This is no longer necessary for users in Office 365. You can recover your deleted or missing mail without having to wait on someone else. Trash or Deleted Items The first place you should look to recover content is the Trash (Mac Mail) or Deleted Items (Outlook) folder. Items that you delete are sent to this folder. If you see your message, select it and drag it out of the folder to your Inbox or other location. Even if you emptied your Deleted Items folder, there is still another option available to you. The deleted messages are retained for 14 days (Duke Health) or 30 days (Office 365). You can still recover your content but you do need to act as soon as you realize you need to retrieve something. Outlook 2013 or 2016 If you use Outlook 2013 or 2016, you can follow these steps to retrieve missing content. Click Deleted Items. Select the Folder tab. Click the button Recover Deleted Items. A new window will open. Everything that can be recovered will be listed. If it is not listed, the content is not recoverable and you will need to contact the person who sent you the information in order to have it back. If you want to put everything back, click the first button in the mini-toolbar (this is Select All). Otherwise, select individual items (Control+ click) or a range of messages (Shift + Click). Click the Recover Select Items button. WARNING: do not click the third button Purge Select Items. All recovered items are restored to the location in your mailbox where there were deleted. Outlook Web Access If you do not use Outlook 2013 or 2016, you can still recover content by using Outlook Web Access (also known as OWA). Follow these steps to use the web version of Outlook. Go to https://mail.duke.edu. Click the Deleted Items folder Right click and select Recover Deleted Items. NOTE: if you do not see this option, look for the Deleted Items folder under your name. A new window will open. Everything that can be recovered will be listed. If it is not listed, the content is not recoverable and you will need to contact the person who sent you the information in order to have it back. Select each message you wish to recover. NOTE: there is a hidden box on the left of the sender's name. A check mark will appear when the message is selected.  The option to Recover is located in the bottom right of the window. WARNING: do not click the Purge option. Finding the source of the missing mail In a situation in which a user is missing mailbox items without explanation (email, calendar items, etc), the very first thing we want to do is isolate or remove the root cause. Root cause analysis We recommend the following: Use Outlook Web App (OWA) to verify missing items.  If items are missing in a client (laptop/desktop or smartphone/tablet) but not in OWA, there is no server-side problem, but only a client-side inconsistency. Use Outlook Web App (OWA) to check for inbox rules.  Remove or disable any that might be affecting these items. Catalog all devices which connect to the affected mailbox, including Duke laptops and desktops Personal laptops and desktops Smartphones and tablets Be sure to review registered devices using OWA (Options, General, Mobile Devices). Disable all such devices Power down laptops or desktops, or remove from the network Power down smartphones and tablets, or remove from the network Use Outlook Web App (OWA) exclusively during the investigatory period Check for and remove likely error conditions Check all laptops/desktops for malware Remove mobile device registration: Remove Exchange account from phone/tablet Delete registration from OWA See "Remove mobile device partnership" at http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2007/05/30/3402915.aspx If message deletion continues at this point, either we've missed a device or the account may be compromised. In this case, change NetID password immediately. Connect devices to the mailbox, one at a time Each time use OWA to monitor for item deletion (increase to the number of items in Deleted Items or Deletions/Recoverable Items) This may need to be done over the course of several hours, depending on the frequency of observed item deletion. If no deletion recurs, consider this device not to be the likely cause and move on to the next. Consider setting up a new local profile in Outlook and other workstation clients and a new local Exchange account on tablets/smartphones. If we have not been able to identify and remove the root cause, moving on to item recovery is not efficient, as items may begin to disappear again after beginning recovery.  This magnifies required effort and delays resolution. Item recovery For the Basic instructions for recovery are here: Outlook for Windows 2016: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-items-in-Outlook-for-Windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce Recovery options are limited on Mac clients Outlook Web App can perform recovery of limited numbers of items (but is not a best choice for large numbers) http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/ms.exch.owap.recoverdeleteditems.aspx

OIT Security desk should still handle system lockouts Difference between types of Maestro Care Reports:  Crystal Clarity and Reporting Workbench (RWB): Operational Reporting   - Reporting Workbench If you ask a user about an operational report that they use, they likely won’t even call it a “report”. It’s a part of their workflow; it’s what they use to do their job. A doctor’s list of appointments for the day, a biller’s workqueue of overdue claims, and a nurse’s list of pending patient transfers to her department: all of these are operational reports. In general, they share the following key characteristics: 1. Time-sensitive. If a report is used to determine who needs a new IV bag, or which bills need follow up, or which beds need cleaning, then the report needs to be up-to-date. If the report is obsolete by the time an end user sees it, nothing else matters. 2. Relatively small. A doctor doesn’t need to know where every patient in the hospital is. He needs to know where his patients are. The rest would just obscure the data he needs to do his job. Operational reports generally put more emphasis on filtering out unnecessary information than they do on showing a comprehensive picture. 3. Easily accessible. Every second that a nurse in the ICU spends looking up her patients is a second she’s not spending caring for those patients. Operational reports must be easily accessible, and often benefit from interactivity – for example, a list of patients that can be used to easily jump to any one of those patients’ medical charts. Analytical Reporting in Clarity - Crystal If a doctor needs to see all of a patient’s clinic appointments over the last month, a number of Epic’s operational reporting tools can give him the answer. If, on the other hand, a scheduling manager needs to see to see the total number of appointments scheduled in each of your clinics over the last year, broken down by clinic and showing the average length of each clinic’s appointments, then those would not be the right tools for the job. The manager’s reporting need is what Epic would call Analytical: A report needed not as a real-time source of data in order to drive a workflow, but as a tool to be used in long-term decision making. Compared to operational reports, analytical reports generally share a very different set of characteristics: 1. Comprehensive. Analytical reports are designed to make sense out of large patterns. To discern large patterns, they need access to large amounts of data. An operational report might display ten data points; an analytical report might display ten million. 2. Summarized. While the analytical report might be based on ten million data points, there are very few people that want a ten million line document. Generally, analytical reports are grouped and summarized. Gleaning a few key numbers out of a vast bulk of data can require much more sophisticated mathematics than are generally required by operational reports. 3. Standardized. The readers of analytical reports are often not Epic end users; they’re management types who expect their data to be presented in a certain format. In additional, they may want to see non-Epic data seamlessly integrated with Epic data. The following are instructions to use when requesting the development of scheduled file transfers associated with Duke Health using AutoMate or File Transfer Assistance in regards to Automate.  Please note that one-time file transfers will not be developed in AutoMate and should be completed using Box.com. To initiate the development of a new file transfer, please use the File Transfer Request in the 'Clinical Application & Devices' section of the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu) Service Request Catalog.  This same File Transfer Request should be used to request changes to or retirement of existing AutoMate file transfers OR File Transfer Assistance.  Once the online form is completed and submitted, non-Assistance requests will generate an approval task for the requestor's supervisor for approval. This auditing is required for requests that will result in a change.  After the supervisor completes the approval, a task is generated for AutoMate support staff which will initiate implementation of the request.  Requests for assistance come directly to the Automate support staff and should not result in a change.  If the outcome of a request for assistance is a change, the request will have to be re-entered to collect auditing information. Please review the bullets below pertaining to tasks the requestor must initiate as part of completing the request form and implementing new file transfer requests. Files transferrred to/from Epic UNIX (epicdb) directories: refer to KB Article KB0016837 for instructions on how to request the creation of a UNIX directory on Epic.  If you need to request a new Epic UNIX directory, please create 2 separate Requests in Service Now (1 for the new directory, 1 for the file transfer).  **If files are being transferred to/from pre-existing UNIX Epic directories, the request for creating a UNIX directory is not needed. Files transferred to/from non-Epic UNIX directories: coordinate with UNIX administrator to create directory to/from which AutoMate will transfer files coordinate with UNIX administrator to create and grant AutoMate user account with read/write/delete access to the newly created directory Files transferred to/from a Windows share/directory: coordinate with Windows administrator to create share to/from which AutoMate will transfer files coordinate with Windows administrator to grant the AutoMate 'DHTS_AutoMate' user account read/write/delete access to the newly created share Files transferred to/from outside vendor: coordinate with vendor to create directory location to/from which AutoMate will transfer files coordinate with vendor to create an AutoMate user account with read/write/delete access to the newly created directory ** The time to implement requests depends highly on the accuracy of information you provide in the 'File Transfer Request', and on the accurate configuration of directories which includes the proper read/write/delete access granted to AutoMate. If you need assistance completing the File Transfer Request, please use the File Transfer Request option for Assistance, in the 'Clinical Application & Devices' section of the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu)  Service Request Catalog -- this will insure your questions will be addressed by the AutoMate support staff member on call in a timely manner.

prompt: Who can use Warpwire?, completion:  Anyone with a valid Duke NetID can use Warpwire to publish media files.
prompt: How are Warpwire accounts set up?, completion:  Account setup in Warpwire is automatic when a valid Duke NetID holder logs in to Warpwire. Where do I log in to Warpwire? You can log in to Warpwire via https://warpwire.duke.edu. Click the yellow button that says Log in. You will be taken to the Shibboleth login page or to the main Warpwire application window if you already have a Shibboleth session open in your browser.
prompt: What type of files does Warpwire support?, completion:  Warpwire currently supports videos, images and audio files A full list of currently supported file types can be found here: https://www.warpwire.com/support/playback/browser-requirements-and-file-types/
prompt: What resolution does Warpwire use for delivering video?, completion:  Warpwire uses Adaptive Bitrate Streaming and currently produces 3 different versions of each video you upload. When a user plays a video, Warpwire automatically delivers the highest quality version of the video the viewer's internet connection and CPU can support. This can change in real time, such that if a viewer experiences a temporary bandwidth glitch, Warpwire will automatically shift to a lower resolution version, and then back up if and when the issue improves. This is how Netflix and most other major online video providers deliver video. The three different versions of the video Warpwire produces have the following specifications: 360p - 640 x 360 @ 550 kbps 480p - 854 x 480 @  1.5 Mbps 720p - 1280 x 720 @ 3 Mbps
prompt: What are the minimum technical requirements for using Warpwire?, completion:  Network Speed: Viewing videos at 360p requires 1.0 Megabit per second Viewing videos at 480p (SD quality) requires 3.0 Megabits per second Viewing videos at 720p (HD quality) requires 5.0 Megabits per seconds Test your network speed here: http://www.speedtest.net/ Latency To stream videos effectively via Warpwire's default method (currently Apple's HLS protocol), your network latency (sometimes called "ping") should be no greater than 150ms. Test your latency ("ping") here: http://www.speedtest.net/) Browser Requirements: See https://www.warpwire.com/support/playback/browser-requirements-and-file-types/ My Warpwire videos keep buffering. What can I do to improve performance? If your videos keep buffering (i.e., showing three moving dots on top of the video), test your network connection for bandwidth and latency via http://www.speedtest.net/). If your bandwidth and/or latency are close to our minimum recommended thresholds, switching the media libraries to Progressive Download may help. To do that, contact the OIT Service Desk (oit.duke.edu/help) if you own the Media Library or Libraries containing the problem files and provide the name and URL of the Libraries in question. If you are not the owner, contact that person (the person who shared the files with you) and request that they contact the OIT Service Desk to switch to Progressive Download or make other arrangements to share the file/s with you. Please note that if you do not have a bandwidth of at least 1 Megabit per second, your best option may be to request that the owner of your Media Library or Libraries move the files to Duke’s box.com site where you can download the videos and view them on your local hard drive. Where can I find documentation for using Warpwire? Duke documentation for Warpwire can be found here:https://warpwire.duke.edu/documentation/ Warpwire's documentation can be found here:https://warpwire.com/support
prompt: When would I use Warpwire vs. YouTube?, completion:  Use Warpwire if you want to secure your videos to Duke NetID holders and groups, such as course groups.

DUKE HEALTH SERVICE DESK ANALYSTS This article refers to end users with two or more security templates (a.k.a. multiple templates) linked to their EMP record. End users are assigned multiple security templates when they perform different roles on different days at different locations. For example, an end user may work as a front desk Monday through Friday at a clinic and as a nurse assistant on weekends at the hospital. Multiple security templates are not to be confused with a "dual role security template" which means one security template that grants access for end users who perform two or more roles during the same work day at the same department. For example, an end user may work as a nurse and a front desk person at a small clinic where people wear different hats. Some security templates can restrict what departments end users can log in to. So, if an end user is unaware of which "job" they selected, in other words, which security template they selected at log-in, they may not be able to find the department they are looking for. Ask them to select the other job role to see if they find the department they are looking for. If they are still unable to find the department they need after selecting the correct job (template), please assign a ticket to the Maestro Care support team that owns that template. You can look this up on the snapshot. Audit History - Important! The EMP Item Audit History (last 6 changes) shows the changes that are made to security templates over time.
prompt: When an end user that is linked to multiple security templates, switches from one job to another (therefore switching from one security template to another), the Audit History records this as a change in access., completion:  This does not mean that a support person changed the end user's access. Do not tell the end user that because it would be misleading. The way to know this is by looking at the "Changed by" column. If the end user's name is listed as the "Changed by," a support person didn't change their access. The end user did by selecting their alternate job role. Question A Duke PDC employee is requesting a deFacto account These procedures apply for all users to ensure the appropriate network and deFacto application access is granted and tracked by the system administrator for new access, changes in employment status and/or termination of employment.

Use of multi-factor authentication may be required for you to access Grouper.  It is required if you are also going to use Blackboard Transact. For more information on how to set up multi-factor authentication for your Duke NetID and password, see http://oit.duke.edu/mfa. The folders and groups that you need to get to for card access will be listed under Duke Card Office, via My Tools → Explore. You may see folders listed that correspond to your department or organizational unit - that's because Grouper can be used for many different tools on campus. Access plans are the way you give a group of particular cardholders access to a group of doors during defined days and times. You can choose date/time patterns like Sunday-Saturday 24/7, or Monday-Friday 8 AM to 5 PM. The access plans that you use will be set up by DukeCard staff when your building is moved to the new card system. It is likely that you will have several access plans for your facilities. For every access plan that you control, you will have a separate folder. In this folder, you'll see several different types of member groups listed. members - this is a group that gives you the listing of everyone who has access. You cannot edit this group, but you can view open it and view the member list. members excludes - this is a group that allows you to remove access from a user to the departmental access plan. If you add a person to this group, they will be removed from the departmental access plan. Note that this does not necessarily ensure that access is removed to an entire area or building. members includes - this is a group that allows you to add individuals to your access plan. If you add a person to this group, they will be included in your access plan. members system of record - this is a group that shows you who is being granted access automatically by virtue of their university affiliations. members system of record and includes - this is a group that shows you the sum of the system of record entries (individuals granted access because of their Duke affiliation) plus the individual users that you have granted access to directly. Depending on how your department plan was configured, you may not see this group displayed. The group called members is a sum of people who you have granted access to directly, plus people who have been granted access by virtue of their university affiliations, minus the people that you have blocked from access through members excludes. That is the group you will view to see the aggregate list of who is included in your access plan. To view who is in an access plan: If you are not already there, navigate to the folder list. Click Explore under My Tools on the left hand side. Click on the Duke Card Office  folder. Click on the Access folder. Click on the Merchant folder. Here, you'll see a folder (or list of folders) corresponding to the access plans for the doors in your area. Click on the folder for the access plan that you wish to view. Note: If you are responsible for more than one building, your folders may be nested. This means you'll see an individual folder for each building, and you'll need to click on the building name folder to get to the access plan folders that correspond to that building. To view everyone included in this access plan: Select Members. Select Manage Members. 3. Under Membership List, select Show all members of this group (direct and indirect) and then select Change Display. A list of your members will display. You will also have a search box to allow you to search large lists for specific group members.  You can search by name, unique ID, or Duke NetID. The way that you will remove access depends on how they got access in the first place. If you granted them access directly (e.g. for an affiliate, contractor, or guest,) you can remove it directly, by removing them from the access plan. If they have access through a departmental plan, you can revoke that access by placing the user in the members excludes group. It’s important to remember that there are two different categories of plans that include your buildings - community/institutional, and departmental.  Most cardholders will be included in one or more of those plans because of how they are affiliated with Duke – and if they leave Duke (resign, graduate, or otherwise,) their access will be revoked shortly thereafter. If someone is part of a departmental plan, you’ll be able to remove their access through Grouper. But if someone is part of a community/institutional plan, you will not be able to remove their access. If you have any concerns about making sure that an individual’s access is properly removed, please contact the DukeCard Office and they will assist you. Removing access that you granted to an individual To remove someone's access, first you need to locate the access plan that they are a part of. Click on the Duke Card Office folder, Access folder, and then Merchant folder to bring up your list of plans. Select the access plan that you want to remove this person from. Select members includes. Under Membership List, select Show direct members of this group if not already selected. Check the box next to the person you want to remove, and click Remove Selected Members. NOTE: If you do not see the person in this group, that means they are likely included in the departmental plan because of their Duke affiliation. Go to the next section (“Denying access to someone who is part of a departmental plan”) for directions on how to remove their access. Finally, verify that the person has been removed. Open the members group for your access plan. Verify that the person does not appear in the members group. You can use the Search function if your members group has a lot of people in it. If you still see the individual in the members group, that means that they are also part of that access plan through their affiliation with the university. That means you need to explicitly deny that person access by putting them into the group members excludes. Denying access to someone who is part of a departmental plan To deny access to an individual in a departmental access plan, you need to put them in the group members excludes. This will ensure that they are specifically denied access to your access plan. Remember that the only time you should have to do this is if you need to control the timing when a person's access is terminated. Keep in mind the naming conventions here are counterintuitive - you are adding someone to a group in order to remove their access. Select the access plan that the individual is currently in. Open the group members excludes. 5. Select Add Members. 6. At the Add Members screen, search for the cardholder. The best practice is to search by Duke NetID or Unique ID to make sure you are locating the right person, but you can also search by name. Click Search to continue. 7. Make sure that the first box under "Select Privileges to assign to members excludes" is checked - it should be by default.  Then make sure the box is checked next to the user that you want to add to this group. If you searched by name and more than one person appeared, make sure you are selecting the right person! Then click "Assign Privileges" to add this person to the group. Remember that adding someone to members excludes removes them from that access plan. Finally, verify that the person has been removed. If at that point, you still see the person in the members group, please contact the Card Office and they will assist you. You may have times where you want to give access to more than one person at a time, or manage access using group lists for individual events or roles - e.g., contractors for a project, or visitors for a workshop. The easiest way to do this is to create groups in the access plans, and then add/remove members from those groups. So, the first step is to create a group. Open the access plan that you wish to create the group for. In this example, I am going to create a group in the Access Plan called Core-24x7. In the access plan, you'll see a folder called local. Double-click on that to open the folder. 3. On the next screen, select Create Group from the options at the bottom. 4. Here is where you actually create the group. You need to give it a name and description that will make sense to you, and to others who might look at it. So in this example, I'm making a group for contractors who need construction access to the first floor. The ID field is required, and it has to be different than the other groups in that folder. The easiest thing to do is to make the ID field the same as the group name. If you happen to pick an ID field that is already in use, Grouper will give you an error message. Also notice Assign privileges to everyone and Select group types are left unchecked. Do not check any of these boxes when creating a group for card access.
prompt: When done, click Save to create your group., completion:  Now that you've created your group, you can add it to members includes. You need to navigate back to your access plan folder. You can go back and start from the top level (My Tools --> Explore), but you can also click on the folder in the breadcrumb navigation menu at the top of the group summary screen. 2. On the Group Summary screen, select members includes. 3. Select Manage Members. 4. Select Add Members. 5. In the Search box, type the name of the group that you want to add. Click Search to continue. 6. Make sure that the box under Select Privileges to assign to members is checked; it should be checked by default. Then make sure the box under Confirm Entities for Assignment is checked; you'll see (and can verify) your group name at the end of that entry. Note that there may be several groups listed depending on how you named the group, so make sure you have checked the right one! Click Assign Privileges to add the group to members includes. 7. You will get a message telling you that the privileges were successfully assigned. Then if you click Return to previous page , you can confirm that your group is now a part of member includes. If you decide to use groups to manage manual lists of cardholders for your access plans, removing those cardholders is a slightly different process. You'll need to go into the group that you created and remove them from the group membership, rather than removing them from members includes. To remove someone from an access group: Locate the access plan that the group can be found in - in this case, the plan is called Core - 24x7. Select Local. 3. Click on the name of the group you want to edit. In this example, I'm going to edit the group First Floor Contractors. 4. Select Manage Members. 5. Check the box next to the name of the individual you want to remove, and then click Remove selected members. 6. You will get a pop-up message like the one below. Click OK to continue. 7. You will get a screen confirming that the person was removed. To archive and/or delete a wiki space, follow the below: Things to note:If the admin wants to archive the space and reuse - send the ticket over to the Systems-UNIX-OIT group in ServiceNow.  Archiving does not guarantee the wiki space can be restored to its previous state.  The UNIX group can assist in getting the archive done correctly.  An change in Confluence versions may also cause the archive to not restore correctly. (Step 1)Log into your wiki space.  You must be an admin to be able to perform the options below:Click 'Space Tools' on the bottom left, then click 'Content Tools'. (Step 2)Click 'Export', choose your preferred archive method and click next.  If the plan is to one day restore the site, XML must be chosen as this is used to restore.  There is no guarantee that the XML backup will work across versions of Confluence.  It is recommended to request assistance from the UNIX group for archiving a possible restored wiki page. (Step 3)Choose 'Normal Export' to export all pages or choose 'Custom Export' to select specific pages. (Step 4)Once the export is complete, click 'here.' under the blue bar. (Step 5)If you are comfortable with deleting the space, go back to 'Space Tools', 'Overview', 'Delete Space'.  Click OK when done. If at anytime there is a question regarding what you are trying to accomplish with your space, contact the OIT Service Desk at 919 684 2200 for assistance. You have access to two systems for managing your building access - Grouper and Transact. Before getting into the documentation about using Transact, it's worth discussing when you would want to use each tool. A basic way to think about the difference is this: Grouper controls how individual cards behave, and Blackboard Transact controls how doors behave. Another way to think about it is that we expect that you will be going into Grouper most often; the requests you are going to get are going to be about individuals getting access to a building, or needing to revoke access for cards - not changing when a door is open or closed in general. Your doors exist in one of two states in the card access system: Controlled: The door requires cardswipe or Prox authentication to enter. For someone to get into a controlled door, they must both have a card and be a member of an access plan that is allowed to enter the door during that time. Unlocked: Anyone can enter the door - no cardswipe required. You will use Transact when you need a door to move between these states. Here are some example scenarios for when to use Transact versus when to use Grouper - and when to call the DukeCard office directly for assistance. Example Scenarios
prompt: What to do?, completion:  Your building is normally open for anyone to enter on Mondays from 8-5 – but next week is a holiday, so you want to make sure that the building is closed that day during business hours. Log into Transact and add a holiday schedule for the day so that it goes from Unlocked to Controlled during the desired timeframe. You have a new contractor working on a project for 4 weeks - he has a DukeCard, and needs to be able to swipe into your building during regular business hours. You would use Grouper for this, not Transact, because you are talking about a cardholder and not a door. So you would log into Grouper and add the contractor to the appropriate group for building access. Your building is normally closed on Sundays, but it's graduation day and there are events inside, so you need to make sure people can get in. Log Transact and add a holiday schedule for the day so that it goes from Controlled to Unlocked so that anyone can enter the building. Your building is normally available for card swipe access (Controlled) from 8am - 5pm, but you've moved new staff into the building, and you now need people to be able to swipe in until 7 PM instead. This scenario involves making a permanent change to an Access Plan, in addition to possibly changing a door schedule. You would contact the DukeCard Office to ask to speak to a staff member to figure out how to make this change. You may also see the option in Transact for a door to be in two other states - 'Locked' or 'Require Pin'. DO NOT USE THESE OPTIONS for your doors. Either of those options will completely lock a door to all access and should only be used by DukeCard staff or emergency personnel. If you need a door to be in a locked state, please contact the DukeCard Office for assistance in properly configuring your doors. Blackboard Transact is run off of an OIT server - you'll need to use Remote Desktop to gain access to it. This is different from Grouper, which is accessed with a web browser. You can use different types of programs to access a Remote Desktop, but the most common one to use is Microsoft Remote Desktop. If you're not sure how to get Remote Desktop on your computer, you should start by contacting your local department support person, who can assist you. Note: your Blackboard Transact username & password is different then your Duke NetID and password. DukeCard staff will provide you with the correct username and password when your area moves to the new system. DukeCard project staff will also provide you a file for your computer called an RDP file. When you open that file, it will open Remote Desktop, and take you directly to the Blackboard Transact interface, where you will log in with your Transact account. You will need to use multi-factor authentication to access Blackboard Transact. Many of you may already have this set up for accessing the old card system (Optim) or for Duke@Work. For more information on how to set up multi-factor authentication for your account, see http://oit.duke.edu/mfa
prompt: When you log into Transact you will see a window that looks like this:, completion:  Please rest assured that while you may see a lot of options on the screen, you do not need to know how everything works. But there are some things we want to make sure you know starting out about Transact and this interface. Access and Passwords You must log into Transact every 30 days or else your access will be locked. We recommend setting a calendar reminder to log into Transact if you don't anticipate using the tool on a regular basis. Also note that your Transact password will expire every 90 days. You will be prompted to change it when you log into Transact. Navigation Controls Appear on the Bottom Navigation between items (and back to the main screen above) will appear as buttons on the bottom of the Blackboard Transact screen. Depending on how your Remote Desktop client is configured, you may need to scroll down or resize your remote desktop window to see those navigation buttons when they appear. Understanding Merchants Merchants are Blackboard's way of designating organizational units for card management. You'll also see this term used in Grouper. Depending on how many and what type of buildings you are responsible for, you may be a member of more than one Merchant. You'll see your current merchant displayed under your Duke NetID, in the top right corner of the screen. If you need to change your Merchant to another one, click on the current Merchant (in this example, 'OIT-Strickland') to bring up the list of merchants available to you, and click Select to pick the merchant you wish to work with. TIP: The only place you can change Merchants is from the first screen that you see when you log into Transact (that looks like the screenshot above). It is best to check your Merchant initially when you log in to make sure you are on the right one - if you click several options into Transact and realize you are on the wrong Merchant, you will have to go back to the beginning to select the Merchant and start over. Before you start, make sure that your Merchant (which are buildings) is set to one that includes the door that you want to work with. If you need to change it, click on Merchant in the top right corner. That will take you to a screen with all the available Merchants (buildings).  You can use the navigation option in the bottom right hand corner to navigate to the appropriate Merchant (building). Once you find the appropriate Merchant (building) you can use the 'Select' option to set that as your Merchant (building). Once you have the correct Merchant (building) selected, under Security → Door State Schedule, click on Query For. 2. Locate the schedule that corresponds to the doors you wish to modify, and click Edit next to that schedule. 3. The next screen shows your Door State Schedule detail. You'll see two parts of the screen - on the left is the standard, preset door schedule. On the right is what Blackboard Transact calls Holiday Schedules. It is best practice to apply a Holiday schedule when you need a door to change. Using the Holiday Scheduling feature lets you limit changes to specific days; it lets you schedule door changes in advance; and prevents a scenario where someone unlocks a door and then does not return it to its previous state the next day. It's worth talking a little bit about the Holiday Schedule interface before continuing our documentation. On the top left, you see a drop-down menu to choose the date that you want the holiday schedule to take effect on. Underneath the date menu, you see two options - Use Day Template and Use Custom Schedule. This document will teach you how to create Custom Schedules. Templates have the potential to be confusing, especially if there are multiple Access Coordinators interacting with particular doors. As you begin to use this tool, if you find that you are changing doors often, you may decide you want to use templates to save time - and if that's the case, we'd ask that you contact the Card Office to discuss setting up appropriate day templates for your doors. Under that is the Schedule interface, and that is where you actually set up your custom schedule.  By default, you'll be presented with a schedule that is controlled the entire day. If you want to change this, presumably that means you have a period of time (or more than one in the day) where you need the door to be unlocked. The way you'll set it up is to use the Enter Time dialog below Schedule to insert break points for the schedule - the start and end times for the periods where you need the door to be unlocked - and then you can modify the door state behavior between those break points. So for example, if I needed a door to be open from 8 AM to 5 PM, I would: Using Enter Time, add 8 AM - which breaks the calendar at 8 AM. Using Enter Time, add 5 PM - which breaks the calendar at 5 PM. Change the drop down for the 8 AM - 5 PM period to Unlocked to open my doors. So for this example, I'm going to create and apply a holiday schedule to my doors to ensure that they are unlocked from 10 AM to 5 PM on a particular day. Click the drop-down menu under Date to choose the date you want the schedule to apply to. You must create and apply holiday schedules one day at a time. 2. Make sure that Use Custom Schedule is selected. Notice that this schedule is controlled 24/7 by default - that's what the blue bar means under Schedule. 3. Go down to Enter Time, and put in the start time for when you want the door to be Unlocked (in this case, 10 AM.) Click Add. Notice that when you hit add, the time slots under Schedule change. A new slot has been added. 4. Now I'm going to add the end time - in this example, 5 PM. And when I do that, a third time slot is created. 5. Now, to set the building so that it is Unlocked from 10 AM to 5 PM, I click on the drop-down for that time-slot to change it. And notice that when you change it to Unlocked, the color on the day schedule changes from blue to green. 6. Click OK to save your changes, and return to the Door State Schedule Detail screen. Notice that your holiday schedule now appears in the Holiday Schedule box. If you wanted to change it, you would select the date and then click Properties below to get back to the Holiday Schedule edit screen; if you wanted to cancel it, you would select the date and click Remove to remove it. You must click OK or Apply to save your changes - if you cancel, your holiday schedule will not save and you will have to start over again.
prompt: When you make a change to a door schedule in Blackboard Transact, that change has to be sent out to the individual door reader(s) in order for it to take effect., completion:  Door readers are automatically updated at 5AM and 5PM. If your schedule change is for a day in the future, you do not have to do anything to update the readers. If your schedule change is for the same day, you will need to put in your change, and then request that the DukeCard office push an update to your readers so that your change goes into effect that day. Step 1: Put your door change into the Blackboard Transact system. Follow the directions in How to Change a Door State Schedule for a Defined Group of Doors to put in your schedule change. Step 2: Fill out a form for the DukeCard office to update your readers. Open a web browser and go to https://dukecard.duke.edu/door-access/access-coordinators/submit-door-requests Select form #2: Download Door Schedules Fill out the form as listed.  Here is an example. Click Submit (once only) to finish.
prompt: When your building was set up in Transact, your doors were grouped together logically and named that way. Rather than having a door state schedule for all 10 doors on your first floor, for example, you may have 3 - one for interior doors, one for computer labs in the building, and one for your laboratory spaces. The idea is that when you need to change a door schedule, you often want to change it in similar groups. If you have a public event, and you want people to get into your building, you would open your exterior doors as a group, without having to adjust 5 doors separately each time., completion:  Having said that, you may run into situations where you need to adjust the door schedule for a subset of doors in those groupings. Perhaps you are doing construction in a teaching space, and need to ensure that the door to that classroom always in a Controlled state, even though other teaching spaces in your building are unlocked between 8 AM and 7 PM. If you modify the door state schedule for the teaching classrooms on your first floor, you'll be changing the schedule for all of the doors in that plan, not just the one door. So, when you find yourself in this situation, please contact the Card Office and ask for the doors that you need to close to be set up with their own Door Access Schedule. They will pull the door or door out into its own grouping to allow you to control access. When you find a point that you no longer need to manage those doors separately, you can then contact the DukeCard Office to ask them to be merged back into their original door state schedule plan. As a Local Facility Authority or Access Coordinator, you have the ability to grant access to the doors and buildings in your area. There are some important concepts to know and understand about your role, and about how individuals get access to buildings at Duke. People are automatically granted access to certain buildings when they join the Duke community. This is a combination of buildings to which all community members have access.   Building access is granted to them according to the way they are affiliated with Duke. For example, a faculty member may be granted access to the buildings where their department resides as well as the Library. A student may be granted access to the Library, their dorm building, and the student center. Those buildings are determined dynamically by how they are affiliated with Duke. Building access is cumulative - you may have more than one access plan on an individual card. For example, a graduate student in the Nicholas School may have a community plan as a graduate student, a departmental access plan as a member of the Nicholas school, plus a residential plan given to them because they live on Central Campus. All of these plans are combined together to give a person access to what they need at Duke. This means that you should not have to grant access to every person who needs to get into your buildings or get through your doors. But if someone needs access to your building and they were not given it automatically, you will need to grant them access. If someone needs access to your building, instead of calling the DukeCard office, they will contact you. Terms to know Blackboard or Blackboard Transact: Blackboard Transact is the new card access control system that Duke is deploying to its campuses. This is replacing an older system referred to as Optim or Blackboard Optim. Depending on your role as a Local Facility Authority, you may or may not use Transact, but you will see it throughout this documentation. Grouper: Grouper is the tool that Duke is using to send data to the card system. To grant or remove access to your buildings for individual cardholders, you will add or remove them from groups in Grouper. Door: Obviously, you know what a door is. But for DukeCard access purposes, a door is a term with very specific meanings. It is an individual access barrier/point that may be locked (inaccessible), controlled (accessible with at least an electronic credential), or open (open to anyone without credentialing).  Doors have door state schedules that denote when they are in a locked/controlled/open state. Door states: A door can be locked, controlled, or opened. These are referred to as door states. When a door is controlled, you can access it when your card permission schedule allows you to. When a door is open, it is open to anyone to enter without using their DukeCard. When a door is locked, you can't access it at all. Note that the locked state should only be used by DukeCard staff or emergency personnel. Permission Schedule and Door State Schedules: A permission schedule for a door defines the times of day when a cardholder is or is not allowed access to that door. A door state schedule defines the times of day when a door is locked, controlled or unlocked. If an individual can't swipe into a door, it usually means that the permission schedule on their card is denying them access. Access Plan: An access plan governs access to one or more doors at a time. It is a collection of permission schedules and door state schedules for the individual doors in the plan. Institutional Plans and Community Plans: These are plans that are determined at the top level of Duke that grant individual types of cards access to buildings based on the type of affiliation they have with the university. Institutional plans grant broad access to a small group (like campus police) and are tightly controlled; Community Plans grant more limited access based on a broad classification of users - e.g. "Faculty/Staff access" or "Student Access". For most users, their sum total of access will be their Community Plans plus their School / Departmental Access Plans. The access you get is cumulative - you can have more than one access plan on an individual card. It is important to know that these access plans are determined at the Facility Access Committee level, and not by individual facility authorities. School / Department Access Plans: These are the access plans that are determined at the department and school level. These are the plans that you will interface with when modifying group membership in Grouper.

To grant door access for an individual, you will need to use Simple Group Management to put them in a group that has access to that door. The easiest way to do this is to find the access plan that grants the access you want to give that person, and then add the individual to the members includes group for that plan. Remember that you should only need to do this if the person is not automatically included in your departmental plan. If you think this person should be getting access because of their affiliation, but they are not in the departmental plan, it is better to contact the DukeCard office first to ask them to investigate before using members includes as a workaround. The first step is to locate the folder that corresponds to the access plan that you are using. Go to dukecard.duke.edu/sgm. Select the access plan that you want to give this person access to. Now that you've got the access plan you need to: Select the group members includes. Select Add New Member. Search for the individual. You can search by name, Duke NetID, or Unique ID.

It’s important to remember that there are two different categories of plans that include your buildings - community/institutional, and departmental.  Most cardholders will be included in one or more of those plans because of how they are affiliated with Duke – and if they leave Duke (resign, graduate, or otherwise,) their access will be revoked shortly thereafter. If someone is part of a departmental plan, you’ll be able to remove their access through Simple Group Management. But if someone is part of a community/institutional plan, you will not be able to remove their access. If you have any concerns about making sure that an individual’s access is properly removed, please contact the DukeCard Office and they will assist you. Check the box next to the person you want to remove. Scroll to the bottom and click Remove All Selected.
prompt: When it asks you to Please confirm: Remove [Number] selected member(s)?, select Yes. You should receive a similar message to below., completion:  Finally, verify that the person has been removed. Open the members group for your access plan. At the Add New Member screen, search for the cardholder. The best practice is to search by Duke NetID or Unique ID to make sure you are locating the right person, but you can also search by name. Click Search to continue. Check the box beside the name of the person you want to remove. When you do, the box beside ID should be automatically checked as well. If you searched by name and more than one person appeared, make sure you are selecting the right person! In the text box beneath End Date, it should say “Indefinite” by default. If you have a specific date in mind, click the box, and it will pull up a calendar for you; select the date you want on that calendar. In the text box beneath Comment, enter a short description about the reason you are removing this person’s access/adding them to members excludes. Select Add Selected Subjects. Remember that adding someone to members excludes removes them from that access plan. If you have a list of individuals to whom you want to grant access, you will need to use Grouper, at groups.oit.duke.edu/grouper. The easiest way to do this is to find the access plan that grants the access you want to give those people, and then add them to the members includes group for that plan. Remember that you should only need to do this if these people are not automatically included in your departmental plan. If you think they should be getting access because of their affiliation, but they are not in the departmental plan, it is better to contact the DukeCard office first to ask them to investigate before using members includes as a workaround. You have two methods of importing your list of users. Through a Text File Verify your list is in a text file—the file name should in in .txt. Make sure the list contains ONLY either DukeID’s or NetID’s, one per line. In the dropdown box, select either DukeIDs – one per line or NetIDs – one per line, depending on which ID number you used in your list. Select Browse, and select the text file on your computer containing the list of users. Select Import Members. Without a Text File If you do not have a text file, follow the instructions below after you select Manage Members. Without selecting a file to upload, click Import members. You will be directed to a page stating at the top that you did not select a file or the file was empty. In the dropbox near the top, select either DukeIDs – one per line or NetIDs – one per line, depending on which form of ID you have in your list.

Office 365 is not an application or website. Exchange Online Exchange Online is a cloud email service that's part of Office 365.  At Duke, Exchange Online hosts our central email services. Exchange Exchange provides email, calendaring, and contact services.  If you work or study at Duke, you probably have an Exchange mailbox.  This is sometimes called an Exchange account.An Exchange user will need to use Outlook Web App, Outlook, or some other client to interact with Exchange. Outlook Web App Outlook Web App (OWA) is a web interface into Exchange.  It allows access to one's mailbox, calendar, contacts, and other data from any computer, anywhere.At Duke, Outlook Web App is available via http://mail.duke.edu . Outlook Outlook is an application which provides a local interface into Exchange.  It allows access to one's mailbox, calendar, contacts, and other data from a single computer.  Outlook is not a website or web application, but is installed locally on a user's computer.  At Duke, for Outlook to work, an Exchange mailbox is required.  (This is sometimes called an Exchange account.) Windows computers may use: Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016. Macs may use: Outlook 2011 or Outlook 2016 (preferably). Shared mailbox, shared calendar A shared mailbox is an Exchange mailbox which is not tied to a specific person, but which has its own email address and its own inbox and other folders.  Shared mailboxes are often used by groups of people who need a central place to manage mail related to a project or a department's operations. To use a shared mailbox, you must have an Exchange mailbox of your own, and your department's IT staff must give you access to the shared mailbox.  You also may need to set up Outlook or Outlook Web App to connect to this shared mailbox in addition to your own personal mailbox. Every shared mailbox has a calendar, and some are used for scheduling group activities, room reservations, or equipment reservations.  Mailboxes used primarily or exclusively for calendaring are often called shared calendars. Distribution List A distribution list is an Exchange object which collects recipients (such as user mailboxes) and allows easy communication to many persons at once.  If a message is sent to the distribution list, it is distributed to every recipient who's a member of that list.Distribution lists appear in the Exchange global address list, which is available from Outlook Web App or any Outlook client.Distribution lists are not the same thing as mailing lists. Mailing List A mailing list accepts mail at a single address (e.g., mailinglistname@duke.edu) and distributes mail to one or more destinations (e.g., a list of a few, dozens, or hundreds of people).Duke offers Sympa as an enterprise mailing list solution.  For more information, see http://lists.duke.edu .Some departments may host their own mailing list solutions; for example, Mailman is used in Duke Medicine.  For more information, see https://email.duhs.duke.edu .Mailing lists are not the same thing as distribution lists.

A YubiKey will allow you to provide advanced authentication to sites without using your phone. To obtain a YubiKey, visit the OIT Site-Licensed Software site. Once you have your YubiKey registered, simply touch the gold disk on it while it is plugged into your USB port to have it generate a pass code. Since the YubiKey acts as a keyboard, click on the location where you want the pass code to be generated before touching the gold disk. For more information on how to use the YubiKey once it is registered, please visit our help page. To register your YubiKey, do the following: Download the YubiKey Personalization Tool. Start the YubiKey Personalization Tool. Insert the YubiKey into a USB port. Wait for the Personalization Tool to recognize the YubiKey. Click Yubico OTP Mode. Click Quick Select Configuration Slot 1 Select Regenerate Uncheck Hide Values Click Write Configuration. Select Yes to confirm. You may be prompted to optionally save the configuration which you can ignore.  Not completing this step will cause the authentication to fail although it appears to be correct in your DUO admin page. You will need the Serial number, Private Identity, and Secret Key from the YubiKey Personalization Tool to register your YubiKey. The image below highlights the locations in the tool where these fields are located.

About Workstation Remote Control Requesting Remote Control Access Initiating a Remote Control Session End Users - Receiving a Remote Control Session Request End Users - Terminating a Remote Control Session Troubleshooting - General tips Troubleshooting - Windows can't open this file: TRCController.jnlp Troubleshooting - Set the default app for the .jnlp file type Troubleshooting - Unable to launch IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller Troubleshooting - Target workstation not showing up in the Remote Control server Troubleshooting - Unable to inject CTRL+ALT+DEL to unlock or log into target workstations Troubleshooting - Application Blocked by Java Security About workstation Remote Control Remote Control allows administrators and other IT personnel such as Service Desk analysts to assist an end user with an issue they are experiencing without having to actually go onsite to where the user's computer is located.  Remote Control allows the Support Analyst to remotely view and even assume control of a workstation. Remote Control at Duke Health is performed using the application "IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control".  This was formerly known as "Tivoli Remote Control". A current version of Java is required to be installed on the computer used to initiate a Remote Control session to another workstation.  The minimum versions include: Sun 1.6, Oracle 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 or IBM® 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  Most Duke Health workstations are using the Oracle version of Java. Note: Remote Control differs from Microsoft's Remote Destop Connection.  RDC provides remote login ability for people.  It has its own interface, separate from the local keyboard and monitor (console) on a computer.  People wanting to access their work computers from home should contact their Local IT Support people about being set up to use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to their work computer. Note: Duke Health Senior Leadership has determined that Remote Control is not to be used to connect to Windows servers.  Access to Windows servers is to be performed using Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection (RDP protocol). If a vendor needs access to a server, the Duke Health administrator is to initiate the RDP connection to the server and host a Duke WebEx connection to allow the external vendor to gain access to the server through the WebEx session.  This is an ISO security policy to protect Sensitive Electronic Information. More information about Remote Control can be found on the Enterprise Systems Monitoring web site, located at: https://intranet.dm.duke.edu/dhts/cto/em/SitePages/Endpoint.aspx Requesting Access to Remote Control Requesting Access to the Remote Control system is performed by submitting a request through the ServiceNow Service Request Catalog.  The Service Request Catalog item is "Account Access Order Guide - Maestro Care, Clinical & Business Applications" and the subitem is: "DHTS System Monitoring Tools". Initiating a Remote Control session Local IT Support staff that have been granted access to the Remote Control system can initiate Remote Control sessions to workstations that have the Remote Control target software installed on them. Prerequisites: Remote Control sessions are Java-based.  A current copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required on the workstation from which you are going to initiate a Remote Control session.  The minimum versions to be used include: Sun 1.6, Oracle 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 or IBM® 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  Most Duke Health workstations are using the Oracle version of Java. The security level of the JRE installation will have to be reduced to allow the JRE to run the Java applet to intiate a Remote Control session. Initiating a session: Using a web browser, go to https://vml-trc.dhe.duke.edu/. Log in with your DHE Active Directory credentials. Upon a successful login, you will be presented with the first page of a list of all target workstations.  You can either browse through them or go to the 'Tartgets' menu and select 'Search': Enter all or part of the workstation's name to search for. The search will return all target workstations with the search string somewhere in the computer name. Select the target workstation by checking the box to the left of the entry in the table. Once a target workstation has been selected, a list of Actions that can be applied to the target is displayed.  Choose 'Start session'. The 'Create new session' page will appear. In the 'Start Remote Control Session' session are the available options available.  Clicking on the 'Active' button will allow full control over the target workstation. The file, TRCController.jnlp, will be downloaded to initiate the Remote Control session with the target workstation. On running of the Java Applet, you may be required to approve a onwe or more security constraints. On connection with the target workstation, the end user will be presented with a popup screen, asking them to either approve or reject the Remote Control session. If the end user sitting at the target workstation refuses the connection, you will receive the following message: If the target workstation is a non-PIN (shared login) workstation and the user takes no action, the Remote Control session will be aborted: If the user accepts the connection or the user is on a PIN (shared login) workstation and takes no action, the Remote Control session will be completed.  A red rectangle will be visible at the top of the screen when a user is logged into the target workstation indicating a Remote Control session is in progress.  The rectangle is transparent and will be always on top of anywindows that might occupy the same space on the screen.  The rectangle will not impede access to anything that it is overlaying. To terminate the Remote Control session, click the  icon at the top left of the window.
prompt: When an IT Support person assisting you with an issue, such as a DHTS Service Desk Analyst, wishes to initiate a Remote Control session, you will see a dialog box pop up on your workstation similar to the one below.  You have three options available to you:, completion:  Click on the 'Accept' button to start the Remote Control session. Click on the 'Refuse' button to prevent the Remote Control session.
prompt: Do nothing.  After the time-out period has elapsed, the Remote Control session request will either be automatically accepted, or automatically rejected, depending on your workstation.  Requests to PIN workstations and identified kiosk workstations are automatically accepted.  Requests to non-PIN workstations are automatically rejected., completion:  End Users - Terminating a Remote Control session An end user has the ability to terminate a Remote Control session from their workstation.  A Remote Control session in progress will be indicated by a red ball with two curved white lines , located in the Windows Task bar in the lower right corner of the screen.  It will either be visible in the Task bar or within the "hidden" icons and made visible by clicking on the double up-pointing arrow: Double-click the red ball to bring up the "IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - Target" window: Click on the  icon on the left side to terminate the Remote Control session. Troubleshooting - General things to check If you are having trouble making Remote Control connections to workstations, there are a number of things to check on: Using the correct URL to connect to the Remote Control server: http://vml-trc.dhe.duke.edu/. Using valid DHE Active Directory credentials: Make sure that your DHE Active Directory credentials are valid and your account has not been locked out.  A simple way to do this is to log onto another system such as Citrix - https://awi.duhs.duke.edu/. Using a current version of the Java JRE on your computer: Remote Control requires Java JRE versions: Sun 1.6, Oracle 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 or IBM® 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  Most Duke Health workstations are using the Oracle version of Java. Lowering the security setting of Java on your computer: The default Security setting, "very High"  for running Java applets is too high for Remote Control.  It needs to be set to "High" or lower in order for the Java to run the 'IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller' applet. Where is the Java Control Panel on Windows? Where is the Java Control Panel on Mac? If you are receiving the message, "Windows can't open this file: TRCController.jnlp", one of two things are the most likely culprit. Check that you have a valid version of Java JRE installed on your workstaion: The minimum versions are: Sun 1.6, Oracle 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 or IBM® 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  Most Duke Health workstations are using the Oracle version of Java. Your web browser has lost the file extension association for .jnlp files: Check the file extension association exists between .jnlp and your Java installation and recreate it if necessary (Troubleshooting - Set the default app for file type). If Java is not invoked and the applet is run when you click on it, or select open as the download action, you probably do not have the correct app association for the .jnlp extension OS X: Select the downloaded .jnlp file. File --> Get Info Confirm that in the "Open with" section it is set to "Java Web Start.app (default)". Click "Change All..." button. Windows 10: Start --> Settings Apps --> Default apps Choose default apps by file type Scroll down to .jnlp Confirm that it is set to "Java(TM) Web Start Launcher". Troubleshooting - Unable to launch IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller If you are receiving the message, "Unable to launch IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller", one of two things are the most likely culprit. Check that you are using a valid version of Java JRE: The minimum versions are: Sun 1.6, Oracle 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 or IBM® 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  Most Duke Health workstations are using the Oracle version of Java. Lower the Security setting on your computer: The default Security setting, "very High"  for running Java applets is too high for Remote Control.  It needs to be set to "High" or lower in order for the Java to run the 'IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller' applet. Troubleshooting - Target workstation not showing up in the Remote Control server If the workstation you are wanting to Remote Control does not show up in the list of target workstations in the Remote Control server, it is either there under a different name or that workstation does not have the Remote Control target software loaded on it. Installation of the Remote Control target software is left up to the Local IT Support administrator(s) of the workstation in question.  Please contact the Local IT Support team responsible for administration of the computer to request that they install the Remote Control Target software. Microsoft, starting with Windows Vista has enabled a security policy, which normally prevents services like the Remote Control service from accessing the security screen for unlocking or logging into a workstation. This setting can be changed either at the workstation or domain level. Here is the procedure for changing the setting on a Windows 10 workstation (other OSes should be similar): Click the Windows (start) button. Enter "gpedit.msc" and press enter, or click on the found, "Edit group policy", app. In the left pane of the Group Policy Object Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Logon Options. Right-click the policy for Disable or enable software Secure Attention Sequence and select Edit (or properties). Click the Radio button in the upper section to be "Enabled". Click the drop down menu in the Options section, below left, and select "Services". Click OK to apply and close the window. Newer versions of Java have implemented tighter security requirements for running Java applets. If you are receiving this error message when trying to open a Remote Control connection to a workstation, it means that the security settings on your Java client are set too high to run the applet. You need to relax the security setting and add the Remote Control server URL into the Exception Site List.

Junk email is evaluated first, and filtered based on the characteristics of the messages themselves, for example the subject or the server it was sent from. Next, Clutter analyzes the remaining messages destined for your Inbox, and filters out the types of messages that you usually ignore or don't respond to, based on your past behavior.

Cisco Jabber is a communications application that provides secure instant messaging services and that integrates with other services—such as the Duke Cisco phone system, Microsoft Outlook, and WebEx—to provide a unified communications environment. After Jabber is set up, you can see whether other Jabber users are available to chat or take a call (based on their Outlook calendar and their computer use), and you can call them through your desk phone or computer, share documents instantly, and invite them to instant WebEx conferences. Jabber works on most computing platforms, including Windows, Mac OS, and mobile devices. Cisco Jabber is usually available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Scheduled maintenance periods and unplanned service degradations are announced through the Duke Health IT Alerts service. To launch Jabber on a Duke-managed Windows machine, go to Start > All Programs > Cisco Jabber > Cisco Jabber. To launch Jabber on a Duke-managed Mac machine, open your Applications folder and double-click the Jabber icon. If Jabber is not installed on your Duke-managed machine (except for PIN workstations in patient-facing areas), contact the Duke Health Service Desk and ask that your ticket be assigned to Desktop Support. To install Jabber on a personal machine, download and install the software from the Duke University Software licensing site URL: https://software.duke.edu. After you download the Cisco Jabber application to a Mac, you must: Open a Finder window and navigate to your Downloads folder. Open a second Finder window, and navigate to the Applications folder. Drag and drop the Jabber icon from Finder window that is displaying your Downloads folder into the Finder window that is displaying the Applications folder. Optional: After you open the Jabber application, you can right-click on the icon in the Dock and indicate that you want to keep the icon in the Dock permanently to make it easier to launch. Because Cisco Jabber is improved frequently, OIT relies on Cisco to maintain detailed documentation.

prompt: When I make a Jabber call between the university and health system, we can’t hear each other. How can I fix this?, completion:  There is a known issue with call routing between the Medical Center and University networks that can cause one-way audio. To address this issue, use a virtual private network (VPN) connection. See "VPN: How to Install and Login to the Duke Health Virtual Private Network (VPN) AnyConnect."

Create a class notebook Click Create a class notebook from the available options. Name your new notebook, and then click Next. Tip: We recommend that you create a separate notebook for each class.For example, if you teach multiple Spanish 2 classes, create a notebook for each class. Give each notebook a unique name that is easy for you and your students to identify. You might name the notebooks “Spanish 2 P1” for your 1st period class, “Spanish 2 P2” for your 2nd period class, and so on. NOTE: Each notebook you create must have a unique name, and it cannot contain these characters # / * ? " | < > : . % ' \.

You can add as many as you'd like. Enter the name(s) of the teacher and click Next. Add your students to your class notebook You can add your students individually or in bulk. NOTE: Your students must have an Office 365 organization account to continue with this step. If you aren't sure whether or not they do, ask your IT Administrator. Add Students Individually Type a student's name in the text box, then press Enter. TIP: As you type, the app will look up possible matches. For example, you can type “Tevin” and it will find any students matching that name. Repeat step 1 until you've added all of your students, and then click Next.

NOTE    You can also add, remove, and delete sections directly in your students’ notebooks after the class notebook is created.

The first option will add the mailbox more for viewing purposes. You will be able to read email from the shared mailbox but whenever you want to send an email "from" the shared mail box, you would always have to click on "from" button and drop the box down from your personal email to the shared mailbox email. Also, your shared mailbox sent mail and deleted mail will always be in your personal sent and deleted mail folders. The second option will add the mailbox so that you are "acting" as this particular mailbox. If you are in the shared mailbox for example, the "from" field will automatically default to the shared mailbox (no manual drop-down necessary) and the sent and deleted items will show up in the shared mailbox's sent and deleted item folders instead of your personal sent and deleted items folders. First option to connect a shared mailbox in Outlook: 1.  Open Outlook 2.  Click on "File" tab in the top left 3.  Account Settings  > Account Settings (see image below) 4.  Double click on your email account (see image below) 5.  Click on "More Settings" (see image below) 6.  Click on "Add" additional mailboxes under the "Advanced" Tab (see image below) Second option to connect a shared mailbox in Outlook: 2.  Click on "New" to create a new email account 3.  Select "Email Account" and then click "Next" 4. Type the shared mailbox address into the "E-mail Address" field and leave all the other fields blank, then click "Next" 5.  When/ if the auto-discover server box pops up, check mark the "Don't ask me about this website again" and then click on "Allow" 5.  When the credentials box pops up asking for your username and password, delete the shared mailbox from the username box and type in your NetID@duke.edu and personal NetID password instead.  This will authenticate your credentials and verify if you have access to this shared mailbox.  If you get a "you do not have permissions.."error message, please contact your local IT support for them to grant you access to that shared mailbox. 6.

License Information This software may be installed and used by Duke faculty, staff, and students on an unlimited number of Duke-owned and personally-owned computers. The site license is funded by OIT and distributed to the Duke community at no cost. The OIT Service Desk provides limited telephone, chat, and e-mail support for X-Win32. OIT Software Licensing maintains a license server for X-Win32. Starnet also provides technical support for this product. Visit www.starnet.com to request support. Product website: http://www.starnet.com/products/xwin32/ A message was created using a "scan to email" feature with printers or scanners. The resulting message should have included an attachment. Instead, the message contains a long column of unreadable text that may start with "Content-Type: application/pdf". Duke uses Microsoft Office 365 as an email and calendaring provider. Duke also has a large number of scanners and printers that include the feature "scan to email". A recent Microsoft update had the side-effect of improperly including the "scan to email" attachment resulting in the attachment being encoded directly in the email message rather than including the scan as an attachment.  As of 10/22/2015 Microsoft is deploying a fix for the underlying issue, but this will not correct data in messages that have already been received. Workaround 1. Open an affected message.2. Copy the message contents starting from “Content-Type: application/pdf;” to the end of the message.3. Open Notepad or other plain-text editor and paste the copied contents into a new blank document.4. Save the document as a “.eml” file type (i.e. use the file extension "attachment.eml"). 5. Using Outlook, open the .eml file. Otherwise, affected users can let the sender know the attachment did not come through intact and request it be rescanned. If I am assigned an Major incident Review, what do I need to do to complete it within the required 5 business day required completion time frame?Note:  The Major Incident checkbox will be checked by the Incident Process Owner when a Major Incident is declared and an Incident Reviewer will be assigned. Once the Incident state is set to "Resolved" the reviewer will be required to fill out the Incident Review Tab (you can start filling out the review prior to resolution, but fields will not appear as required until resolution).   The Incident Process Owner will close the incident anytime after the normal 10 day "resolution to close" window....it can stay in a resolved state as long as it takes to do the review if longer than 10 days. The closure of the parent ticket for a Major incident is a manual process due to the incident review process. To kick off the process, you will be sent an automated email from Service Now once the Incident is resolved.  The Incident Process Owner may also contact you if the Incident is not resolved once the Major Incident is over to ask for it to be resolved and additional root cause work be done in a Problem record. Once you are aware of the review, you can find it by clicking on the My Open Major Incident Reviews link in the Service Desk section.As soon as you begin working on the review, please change the Incident Review status, to In Progress and fill in the required fields on the Incident Review tab (indicated in red text below for DHTS) and click Update. Once the required fields are completed and you have captured any of the other optional fields data, change the Incident Review status field to Completed where you will be prompted to put in Incident Review completed by and Incident Review Completed on fields. Note:  If for some reason the Incident you are doing the review on, is re-opened by the customer or another ITIL user and the Incident Review was not completed, once the Incident State is set back to resolved (by you or some other ITIL user),  the review fields will then become required again if they are blank/not completed. Below are the fields and definitions to help you complete the form for Duke Health.  Please note, if DHTS resolves the issue the Service Provider should be Duke Health and the appropriate Services selected/changed.If the incident's Service Provider is Duke University, different fields display for an separate/different OIT review process.

UPDATING PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS There are times when a provider receives demographic information from a patient or family that has not been documented by the front desk or scheduling team. This can happen on call, or during an office visit. Providers now have the ability to update the demographics tab. Here are the basic functions and some cautions: ACCESSING: The Demographics function can be accessed in three places: By clicking the “Patient” hyperlink from the SnapShot Activity in the Multi-provider schedule: By clicking the “Patient” hyperlink from the SnapShot Activity within an encounter: From the Demographics Activity within the encounter. This lives as Activity tab by default in the traditional view and can be found under More Activities in the Wide Screen view. UPDATING: There are 4 main things that providers should update: Patient phone numbers. Patient email address. Patient emergency contact/family contact information. Patient preferred name (Nickname). CAUTIONS: Two fields providers should NOT update are ... Address field: Changing the address here does NOT change the patient’s address in the billing fields. Having discrepancies between addresses within the chart can cause billing and legal issues. Please ask your front desk/scheduling team to correct the address. If they are corrected through Cadence (the scheduling and registration) fields, they will flow INTO this section. Patient status: Changing a patient’s status to deceased has major implications throughout the system. Please have your front desk/scheduling team help you make that change In the future, additional training and direction will be provided about the Advanced Directives fields.

License Information and Restrictions Faculty/staff licensing Student licensing Computer Lab licensing License Information and Restrictions At no cost, Duke provides Creative Cloud subscriptions to all students (while enrolled) and creative cloud software for all Duke-owned lab computers.  Annual Faculty/Staff licenses for both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud (Acrobat) are available for purchase through OIT. Location Restrictions: None Hardware Restrictions: Licensed software may only be installed on Duke-owned computers or faculty/staff/student-owned personal computers.  No computers owned, used, or leased by non-Duke entities. Additional restrictions for Lab Computers: The no-cost version available for lab/classroom computers requires that the computers (1) allow use by ALL Duke students, faculty, and staff, and (2) require each user to enter a NetID or other Duke account to login. Computers where access is restricted to specific users/schools/departments or where login is not required do not qualify and would require named user licensing Affiliation Restrictions: Duke faculty, staff, students, and affiliates only.  Alumni (without any of the other affiliations) may not purchase or use this software under the Duke agreement. Annual licenses (accounts) for both Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud (Acrobat Pro DC) are available for purchase through OIT by Duke faculty and staff.  The license expires on October 8 each year, and renewal licensing will need to be purchased each year for continued access. The purchase of an account/license for or by a faculty/staff member entitles that person to license and install licensed products on both Duke-owned or personally-owned devices for personal use. Each account allows an individual user to install and activate desktop applications on two computers, regardless of operating system, for individual use.  Accounts may not be shared, but if an account holder has transferred or left the organization, the account may be transferred from one user to another The default method of deployment for faculty/staff is self service.  With this method, users will download products directly from Adobe.com and install and update the software themselves. For shared or managed computers, there is a "Named User" package that can be deployed.  Named License deployment ties the usage of Adobe apps and services to an individual user. Named licensing works well if the product and service requirements are closely associated with a user or a role. Named licensing provides IT admins complete control to add and remove product licenses for a user at any time. Named licenses require periodic Internet connectivity. Computers must connect to Adobe servers for initial activation, and then at least once every 99 days.  The default named user package has the creative cloud apps panel (allowing users to install and updated applications themselves) and updates disabled.  A new named user package will be made available during winter and summer academic breaks. No cloud services are enabled, so attempting to sign into some services within certain applications will result in an Access Denied error message. All Duke students have access to Adobe creative cloud at no cost. Students will log in with an Enterprise ID at Adobe.com and access desktop downloads.  All student licensing will be self-service, allowing students to download products directly from Adobe and install and update the software themselves. Student accounts are automatically provisioned and de-provisioned as they enroll at and leave Duke.  No cloud services are enabled, so attempting to sign into some services within certain applications will result in an Access Denied error message. Lab Computers Duke may deploy Creative Cloud software within its Enterprise on each Duke-owned computer in computer labs and classrooms for use by all students, faculty, or staff.  Lab installers for Creative Cloud are serialized and do not require authentication or activation once built.  See the detailed licensing restrictions above for limitations. IT administrators will be required to sign an SLA in order to gain access to lab installers.  Please contact OIT Software Licensing for more information. For account support and licensing questions, e-mail OIT Software Licensing.  For product support, contact Adobe support through normal channels. Knowledgebase Articles: I have a Duke license, but I can only access trial versions I have a paid retail account, and I want to cancel it and switch to a Duke license General information and licensing restrictions

It can also be caused by an error on the Adobe side that does not provision resources properly when the account was created.  Signing out and back in can resolve this, as can clearing the cache.  In some cases, the account needs to be deleted and re-provisioned. It can also be caused by a bad hosts file in limited instances, and this is most common when end users have had previous versions of Adobe creative software installed on their computers. Finally, your login may have expired.  Faculty/staff accounts need to be renewed annually on October 8 to continue use.  Student accounts will be deactivated upon graduation or leaving Duke.

OnBase Locks Locks in OnBase are the way that OnBase prevents corruption.  When you start to work with a document or process within OnBase, the system places a lock on it to prevent other users from editing the same document at the same time. With normal usage, locks remove themselves when you finish working with a document. If you do not finish working with the document before closing/force-closing OnBase, the lock will not be removed. Best practices to avoid locks are to close documents, workflow window, or scan queue window, before exiting out of OnBase. Within Document Imaging (scan or fax queue): to find a particular document within a batch, right-click on the batch name, and select View Documents to look through the documents in the batch.  Once the document is located, index the batch.  If indexing has started on a batch, and there is a need to move to a different batch or close OnBase, click the Stop Indexing  button to remove the batch lock.  The batch will move to Index in Progress. This article addresses the following OnBase pop-ups "Document checkout locks assigned to your username appear to have been left open from a previous session.  Do you wish to view/remove these locks?" or "Access Denied. User ' ' is already working with this document. " If the user name is your name: Please follow the instructions below. If the user name is one of your coworkers, ask them to let you know when they are finished with the document, or have them follow the steps below 1 of the 1 entries selected are currently not available for processing.  It may be that another user is already working on this batch. If this is not the case,  please notify your system administrator. If you receive this message for longer than 2 hours, you can place a Request to have the lock removed.  Please include all batch numbers in the request Waiting for Lock from user ___ at workstation __ for disk group __ If this error is present for longer than 15 minutes and the user ID and the disk group are the same, please call the Service Desk to place an incident. If this pop-up appears when you log into OnBase, click "Yes" It is also accessible through User --> Locked Objects: For each document listed: Highlight the document Right click --> “Remove Selected” Click “Yes” That document will be removed, and repeat steps 1-3 for each document.

A Duke Exchange Online (Office 365) user receives multiple, repeated responses to a meeting invitation (indicating an acceptance, a declination, or a tentative response). One of the persons invited to this meeting responded to the invitation using an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) running iOS 9.1. A bug in iOS 9.1 results in repeated meeting responses. This cannot be resolved by the person who is receiving the repeated meeting responses.  This must be resolved by the person who is initiating the repeated meeting responses. The only solution we can recommend is that you remove the Exchange account from your iPad and iPhone. These repeated notifications will stop. You may, if you wish, then add the Exchange account again. To avoid this kind of issue in the future, we would recommend against managing meetings on a smartphone or tablet. For more information, please see our Exchange calendar management – Best practices summary article. In OnBase Enterprise Client, or the OnBase Client, how do I view an OnBase Document's Keywords?

Call the Service Desk at 919-684-2243 to speak with a service desk representative Which version of Office should I use?
prompt: How do I activate Office for Mac?, completion:  Troubleshooting specific errors when activating manually with the KMS. In terms of functionality, all of them are exactly the same.  They only differ in terms of licensing and activation. Duke-Owned Computers: volume-licensed standalone version - This version is not tied to users' accounts and may be installed and activated on an unlimited number of computers for Duke purposes. The Windows version uses volume license activation, which activates with either a KMS license server (default, recommended) or a product key (MAK - used for offline or off-campus work computers).  The Mac version does not require activation. Personal Computers, Student Computers, Mobile Devices, and Working from Home: Office 365 - Through Office 365, all Duke faculty, staff, and students may install and activate Microsoft Office software on up to five computers and mobile devices simultaneously.  The Office 365 license is activated with your Duke netID. Non-Duke use (Faculty/Staff): Home-use copy - Microsoft has designated a special license program for employees specifically for personal use called the Microsoft Home Use Program. Under this program, Duke faculty & staff may purchase one personal license of Office for $14.99. Each Duke faculty or staff member is limited to one purchase of each product. Graduating Students: Student graduation copy - Students should use Office 365 until shortly before graduation.  Upon leaving Duke, netID-activated software will cease to function, and it will be necessary to purchase a license to continue using it. Students are entitled to a free, perpetual graduation license of Microsoft Office which will allow the installation of Office on one Mac or PC. This license will work perpetually on one computer after a student graduates. Since the student option only allows one installation of one version of Microsoft Office ever. It is recommended that students use Office applications through Office 365 while at Duke (can be used on up to 5 devices) and then access the student option prior to graduating. It is recommended that students only access the graduation copy during their final semester since only one download and installation is permitted.  Additionally, the website is netID protected, so you will lose access to be able to get the graduation copy once you graduate. Should I use the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version of Office for Windows? If users in your organization depend on existing extensions to Office, such as ActiveX controls, third-party add-ins, in-house solutions built on previous versions of Office, or 32-bit versions of programs that interface directly with Office, we recommend that you install 32-bit Office (the default installation) on computers that are running both 32-bit and 64-bit supported Windows operating systems.  If some users in your organization are Excel expert users who work with Excel spreadsheets that are larger than 2 gigabytes (GB), they can install the 64-bit edition of Office. In addition, if you have in-house solution developers, we recommend that those developers have access to the 64-bit edition of Office so that they can test and update your in-house solutions on the 64-bit edition of Office. Back to top of page This software may be used online and accessed via mail.duke.edu (upper left-hand corner). To download and use as standalone applications, see the following KB article: https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/office-365-software-apps The software is activated with your Duke netID, and you will need to sign in periodically.  If the sign-in screen doesn't automatically recognize that you are using your Duke account, you'll need to indicate that you are using a Work/school account. Office 365 Education for Faculty, Staff, and Students is an Office 365 plan that is available for free to Duke faculty, staff, and students who attend or work at academic institutions that have purchased Office for faculty and staff. This plan allows Duke students and employees to install Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access on up to 5 PCs or Macs and Office apps on other mobile devices including Windows tablets and iPads. The plan also includes 1TB of OneDrive for Business storage, managed by the school, and employees and students can edit and collaborate using Office Online, Yammer, and SharePoint sites. Students can use the plan until they graduate or are no longer enrolled at a qualified school, and faculty/staff may use the plan until they leave Duke. Duke affiliation may be re-verified at any time by Microsoft. At expiration, the Office applications enter a reduced-functionality mode, which means documents can be viewed but it isn’t possible to edit or create new documents. In addition, online services associated with the school email address, for example Office Online and OneDrive for Business, will no longer work. For this reason, prior to graduation, students should download a graduation copy of Microsoft Office, which will allow them to continue to use Microsoft Office on a single Mac or PC at no cost. The graduation license is perpetual and does not expire. KMS Activation: KMS is the default method of activation for all Duke users, and should be used whenever possible and/or applicable.  When installing Office while on a Duke network physically or via VPN (instructions are in the below section), activation should occur automatically during installation with no additional steps.  If activation does not occur automatically, see below sections on activating manually via the KMS.
prompt: How KMS activation works:, completion:  Once an installation of Office has completed, it will automatically search for the KMS server. Machines with DNS win.duke.edu, oit.duke.edu, and duke.edu should work with auto discovery. Other departments with third level DNS such as .duke.edu may need to add the entry for these users to be able to use auto discovery. You can verify automatic activation by opening any Office application other than Outlook (Word, Excel, etc.) and going to File -> Help and then looking on the right column.  If the product is activated, it will say "Product Activated."  Otherwise, you will need to take additional steps. The Microsoft Key Management Server activates a client for a period of 180 days. Once an instance of Office is activated, it will attempt to communicate with the same KMS every 7 days to renew it's activation; resetting its license counter back to 180 days. If the machine is unable to connect to the KMS, it will keep trying to do so silently every 2 hours until it is successful.If the machine hasn't been able to reestablish communication to the KMS after 180 days, Office will become unlicensed and go into a 30 day grace period, notifying the user of this change. If Office is not activated against the KMS after the 30 day grace period, it will enter a reduced functionality mode until it is able to connect to it's KMS or is changed to a MAK license key and activated. MAK Activation: If you cannot easily communicate with the KMS, you may use or switch to the Multiple Activation Key (MAK) license. MAK activates systems on a one-time basis, using Microsoft’s hosted activation services. The MAK-based license is best suited for machines that are not regularly connected to a Duke network (locally or with VPN), such as Duke-owned laptops primarily used off-site. While not highly restricted, we ask that if you connect to any Duke network on a regular basis that you use the KMS method of activation. If you are having difficulty activating via KMS, please try to troubleshoot the error before resorting to the MAK.  We have a limited number of MAK activations available.  You may request a special MAK by e-mailing site@duke.edu.  Requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by OIT. The OIT Service Desk has prepared detailed instructions on using VPN (virtual private network) and they can be found here: VPN Instructions & Overview Once you are connected to VPN, either install Office if you haven't done so to activate automatically during installation, or follow the manual activation instructions below. You can verify automatic activation by opening any Office application other than Outlook (Word, Excel, etc.) and going to File -> Help (Office 2010) or File -> Account (Office 2013) and then looking on the right column.  If the product is activated, it will say "Product Activated."  Otherwise, you will need to take additional steps to activate manually. You must be on a Duke network either physically, or via VPN, and you must have administrative rights on your computer.

Office for Mac obtained through Office 365 uses netID authentication for activation, and there is no product key available. The home use version of Office for Mac uses a product key that is included with your purchase. Error 0xC004F039 This error may occur if you are attempting to activate using the manual KMS instructions above, and you are not connected to a Duke network either locally or with the VPN client. Please make sure you are connected to a Duke network and try again. Error 0xC004F06C or Error 0xC004F074 This issue may occur if the system time on the client computer differs from the system time on the KMS host. To work around this issue, change the date and time to the current date and time.  We recommend that you use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) time source or the Active Directory directory service to synchronize the time between computers. Time is coordinated between the KMS host and the client computer in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Error 0x80070005 This error occurs most commonly when the command prompt is not launched as an administrator.  You can do this by selecting Start - All Programs - Accessories - then right clicking Command Prompt and selecting 'Run as administrator'.  This error also may occur if you do not have the proper privileges on the computer or your network to activate the software. These errors can also indicate a permissions error in the registry.  Please visit https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-error-code-0x80070005-when-activating-office-7aa7600f-df57-4aef-81d2-25509c66f865 for methods to correct this error.  These methods can be very technical, and if you do not feel comfortable performing these operations on your computer, please contact your IT department.

SAS software is now available at no cost to Duke through a grant to NCICU schools. Duke SAS licenses expire annually on June 30 with a grace period of 90 days after that. SAS may only be installed and used by faculty, staff, and affiliates on Duke-owned or Duke-leased computers for Duke purposes.  Students may install SAS on Duke-dedicated, student-owned computers as well. If you just need to use SAS occasionally, if you have a Mac (and don't want to install Windows to install SAS), need to use SAS from an international location, or if you don't want to go through the trouble of installing SAS, all Duke faculty, staff, and students may now access SAS 9.4 through the OIT Virtual Computing Lab. The software may be installed in one of 3 ways: Connecting to the OIT SAS software depot (network share) and running the installer.  This method is the fastest, is free, and no downloading is required, but it can be somewhat technical.  Additionally, not all users, particularly those on some health system networks, will be able to install from the network share due to security restrictions. Downloading disk image files (ISOs) and either burning installation DVDs and installing from disk or extracting the compressed files into folders and using folders as you would DVDs to install.  This method is the most time-consuming because of the download and burn/extract process, but it is also free and is an alternative for those who cannot go pick up installation media or connect to the server to install over the network. Purchasing installation media and installing locally.  This method is fast and non-technical, but there is an additional fee for this option.  The SAS installation files are preloaded onto 64-GB USB drives and sold for $20 each.  Once SAS is installed, you can erase the files and use the drive for other purposes.

prompt: What looks like the contents of a folder should appear.  Double-click setup.exe to begin installation., completion:  Note: If you do not see setup.exe, it may be because known file extensions are hidden on your operating system.  Click the second setup file in the list; the one with the 'S' icon. Follow the installation instructions below if you are unsure how to proceed. If you are having trouble connecting to the depot, see the troubleshooting instructions below. Access Denied: If you have been given access to the server, but are denied access due to invalid credentials, please do the following: Reset your netID password.  This server uses netID-active directory synchronization, and your netID password must be synchronized with your active directory password on win.duke.edu.  Resetting your password, even if you have done it recently, is the best way to make sure the passwords have been synchronized.  For more information, see https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/netid Restart your computer.  It is important that you restart your computer after changing your netID password before trying to access the server again.  Windows may store your old credentials and you may not be able to enter your new password and access the server without restarting. You can also use the net use commands to delete any active connections and drive mappings to the server, but restarting is a sure thing. Try again.  Once you have reset your netID password and restarted the computer, follow the instructions above to map the drive Make sure you are authenticating with WIN\netID where netID is your netID.  If you just enter your netID without WIN\ in front of it, you will not have the privileges to access the depot if you are on a different domain or workgroup. If you get the error there are no logon servers available to service the logon request If this error occurs consistently after you connect to the depot and when you run setup and you are on a Duke Medicine or Health System network, it is most likely a permissions issue that cannot be resolved by OIT Software Licensing.  Ensure that your firewall, group policy settings, and/or permissions on the computer are not preventing you from installing the software.  For example, you can try running setup at a different location or on a computer in a different OU.  You could try to remove the computer from the domain temporarily for the installation. If you are in the health system and are not able to resolve this error, you will need to install using different means, such as using ISO files or purchasing a USB drive. Non Health System: If not on a Duke Medicine network, this may be caused if one of the domain controllers has a hung process or some other sort of error.  Since they are load-balanced, the best thing to do is to disconnect the network connection and attempt to connect again so that you will hit a different domain controller. Restart your computer.  This will reset any connection errors and allow you to map the drive without the use of the net use commands. The other option is to disconnect with the net use commands. Open a command prompt window as an administrator Type net use and press enter.  This will show you a list of your currently connected drives. Type net use /d #: where # is the drive letter that the SAS server was mapped to.  For example, if you used Z, you would type net use /d Z: and press enter Type net use again and the connection should have been deleted Try to connect with VPN If Windows can't find the server, or if it hangs while attempting to connect: Make sure you are connected to a Duke network.  If you are on the university or a health system campus, you should be covered.  If you are elsewhere, or possibly on some private networks on campus, you should use the VPN client to connect and then map the drive again.

QUESTIONS Contact the OIT Service Desk: http://oit.duke.edu/help/index.php This KB is organized in a manner to assist the requester in understanding the technical language that should be used to successfully submit a detailed request. Which should result in a fast delivery of the requester's goals. Here's a brief background on the technical definitions that may be needed to satisfy your request:
prompt: What is a Domain Name?, completion:  Generally speaking, domain names are the familiar, easy-to-remember and always unique names of computers on the network. For example, duke.edu is a domain name.
prompt: What is DNS?, completion:  DNS simply translates domain names into the numeric IP address because humans find IP addresses hard to remember. For example, it's much easier to remember duke.edu instead of the IP address 152.3.72.104.
prompt: What is an IP address?, completion:  An IP address is used to uniquely address a machine on a network in numerical (IPv4) or alphanumerical (IPv6) form. It is important that we understand the concept of “network” used here to be relative to what we are trying to achieve. For instance, trying to contact another computer inside Duke's network means that the IP address of the machine you are trying to reach must be unique within Duke. In terms of websites and publicly-accessible information available via the Internet, the “network” is - in fact - the Internet.
prompt: What is an A Record?, completion:  An "A" record links a domain name to an IP address. For example, the A record for duke.edu is the IP addresss 152.3.72.104. This lets your browser know where to send your web browser request.
prompt: What is a CNAME?, completion:  A "CNAME", lets you point a domain name to another domain name. For example, www.duke.edu points to duke.edu. As a result, if you enter www.duke.edu in your browser, your computer resolves www.duke.edu and sees it is an alias for duke.edu. It then resolves the duke.edu DNS name to an IP address in order to route your request.
prompt: What DNS is not?, completion:  DNS does not allow you to point, yourdomain.duke.edu to http://duke.edu/someplace If you are trying to point a website at another location, ie: a hosted webspace such as wix.com, then you will need to seek guidance by your hosting provider to determine how to proceed for your situation. If this is an internal redirect (ie: pointing to another duke.edu site) you may need to contact Duke Web Services (or maybe the OIT Hosting group?) to fulfill your request. Please remember to provide as much details as possible, as this will expedite your request fulfillment. Please browse to https://oit.duke.edu/help/index.php to open a ticket with OIT's Service Desk to complete your request.
prompt: How do I request to add or update SER records for External Providers or External Places?, completion:  ANSWER Background: An External Provider is defined as a provider (MD, NP, PA, or others) who does not work within the Duke University Health System (DUHS, DRH or DRAH). An External Place is defined as an outside organization that is not listed in Maestro Care as a Department or Facility. Examples of Internal Departments are Harris & Smith Regional Pediatrics Duke Primary Care at Southpoint Internal places are found by searching in Department or Location/POS search boxes in the referral and follow-up workflows.
prompt: How to Request Changes:, completion:  If you wish to have the information of an External Provider updated or added, please contact the Service Desk and provide the following information about the provider: Title NPI number if available Address Phone number Fax number
prompt: HOW TO CONTACT THE SERVICE DESK, completion:  Please assign tickets related to these requests to For more assistance please assign tickets to the Service-Now group Duke Consultation and Referral Center. Duke University is a partner in the eduroam network which is available at Duke and other partner institutions (a listing of participating organizations is available here). We recommend the installation of the eduroam profile if you will be traveling and need to connect to wireless services away from campus. In order to connect to the secure network, adjustments will need to be made to your computer network settings. This process is simplified through the use of an installer. Follow these steps to configure your eduroam connection for Mac OS X so you can take advantage of this layer of security. This article was created and tested using a computer running Mac OS X 10.9.4 and was reviewed on subsequent releases up to Mac OS X 10.11. You must be running Mac OS 10.5 or greater to install this software. Connect to the Duke wireless network. Go to https://dukeblue.duke.edu/eduroam/ and click the JOIN Secure Wireless Network link. The web page will display information about your computer including the operating system and version number. If this information is incorrect, select your computer OS version from the pop-up menu at the bottom of the page. Click the button JoinNow which will download the software SecureW2_JoinNow.dmg installer. Within your Downloads folder, double-click the SecureW2_JoinNow.dmg which will mount the installer and open a new window. Double-click the SecureW2_JoinNow application. If you receive a warning that the application is downloaded from the Internet, click the Open button. In the window that appears, enter your Duke NetID and password and click Next.
prompt: When prompted, enter your local administrative password on your computer (this may be different from your Duke NetID password)., completion:  You may also see a prompt that the Wi-Fi.app wants to use information from your keychain. Select the option Always Allow (you should not see this prompt again) or Allow (you will see this message each time you connect to eduroam). Click Done to complete the installation and verify your wireless connection is set to eduroam. NOTE: You should routinely verify that your wireless connection has joined eduroam. In any given location, a large number of networks are available and your computer may not default to eduroam. If you are not connected to eduroam, you will not be able to advantage of the enhanced security this network provides. Setting preferred network You can modify your network settings to prefer the "eduroam" if it is available. Open Apple -> System Preferences and select Network (this is also available under the Wi-Fi icon in the Menu Bar as Open Network Preferences...) Click the Advanced button and the Wi-Fi tab. All Wi-Fi networks you have joined will be listed. Locate the eduroam network and drag it to the top of the list. Click OK to save changes. Manually Connecting to eduroam It is not necessary to run the installer to connect to eduroam. Follow these steps to manually connect. Select eduroam from the Network Name pop-up menu. You should now be connected to the eduroam network. If you are still having difficulty connecting to eduroam, please consult with your local IT support, or contact the OIT Service Desk at 684-2200.

We recommend the installation of the eduroam profile if you will be traveling and need to connect to wireless services away from campus. In order to connect to the secure network, adjustments will need to be made to your computer network settings. This process is simplified through the use of an installer. Follow these steps to configure your eduroam connection for Windows so you can take advantage of this layer of security. NOTE: Some Android devices may require a four-digit security pin after installing the eduroam certificate. Please note that for Google Pixel devices(all versions), you will need to manually connect to eduroam. 1. Open a browser and go to https://launch.dukeblue.duke.edu/ 2. Scroll down to the Off Campus section and click the Join Eduroam button. 3. The system should detect you are using an Android.  Click Download for the Google Play store.  (Note: you will need to return to this page after installation to connect to eduroam.) 4. Click JoinNow. 5. Click INSTALL for the SecureW2 JoinNow app. 6. Click ACCEPT to complete installation. Please note that in the next step(#7), you should NOT click Open. 7. Once installed, DO NOT CLICK OPEN.  Go back to the browser window for https://dukeblue.duke.edu/eduroam. 8. Back on https://dukeblue.duke.edu/eduroam, click  JoinNow. 9. Enter your NetID and password and click Continue. 10. When you receive dialog box below, Click Done. 11. Verify you are connected to eduroam by checking your wireless settings. If you are still having difficulty connecting to eduroam, please consult with your local IT support, or contact the OIT Service Desk at 684-2200. Duke University has implemented a secure wireless network known as Dukeblue which uses the authentication mechanism WPA-2 Enterprise and 802.1X. When correctly installed and configured, this network will protect your Duke NetID and password, and ensure that your data and transactions are secure and protected. These steps require local admin rights in order to be successfully completed.  Follow these steps to configure your Dukeblue connection for your Linux computer so you can take advantage of this layer of security.  These instructions are intended for the initial connection to Dukeblue.  After you successfully complete these instructions, if you connect to another wireless network, and re-connect to Dukeblue, you should NOT need these instructions. These instructions are written for the Ubuntu Linux operating system. Please Note: Make sure the machine is within range of an 802.11 AP that’s broadcasting the Dukeblue SSID. This can probably be done without that, but it’s easier if you’re in a location where Dukeblue is available. 1. Log in to the desktop and wait for the dashboard at the top of the X server screen to fully populate. 2. In the upper right of the screen, right-click on the WiFi icon to bring up its options menu. 3. Select Edit Connections…  from the menu. 4. Depending on the machine’s history, there may be one or more wired or wireless connections listed. Click Add  to set up the Dukeblue network. 5. For Connection type select Wi-Fi, and click Create to create a new WiFi profile. 6. The resulting dialog box will have a number of different tabs in it. On the Wi-Fi tab, set the following values: Connection name: Dukeblue SSID: Dukeblue Mode: Infrastructure MTU:   Automatic Leave the other options blank (as they will be filled in automatically when the connection is established). 8. On the Wi-Fi Security tab, set the following values: Security: WPA & WPA2 Enterprise Authentication: Protected EAP (PEAP) PEAP version: Version 0 Inner authentication: MSCHAPv2 Username: <your NetID> Fill in your NetID password in the Password: field or check the Ask for this password every time checkbox in the tab. You must do one or the other in order to continue, however — there is no default. 8. Optionally on that same Wi-Fi Security tab, you may set: * Anonymous identity. If set, this will change the outer identity passed to the RADIUS server during the authentication process. This is of little value in the Dukeblue case, since the RADIUS conversation for Dukeblue is directly between the client and our local RADIUS servers. In cases (such as eduroam) where there are intervening proxy RADIUS servers, the anonymous identity controls what the proxy RAIDUS servers see as the user’s identifier. In this case, it’s not really relevant and can safely be left blank. * CA Certificate: The 802.1x supplicant wants to be pre-populated with a trusted root CA certificate it can use to verify the signature chain on the TLS certificate presented by the RADIUS server it will be using to authenticate to the WiFi network. It’s possible to operate the 802.1x client without a certificate specified, but doing so will result in a warning message every time the client connects (or until the user suppresses it) indicating that the identity of the RADIUS server can’t be verified and that it’s possible the user is being MITM’d. If you want to avoid that, download the AddTrust External CA root signing certificate to the machine — it’s available at: https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Default/Knowledgebase/Article/View/917/91/ and save it in a text file on the machine, then use the “CA Certificate” button in the Wi-Fi Security tab to load the certificate from that file into the wireless profile. 9. Optionally, you can fill in IPv4 and IPv6 details on the other tabs in the dialog. I think for most users the defaults will be correct — only adjust those settings if you know that you need to. 10.  Click Save to save the profile. If you chose not to load a certificate in step 8, you will get a warning message at this point that will offer to take you back to the configuration for loading a certificate. 11. If you didn’t enter a password in step 8, you’ll be prompted for your password now. Enter it and click Connect in the new dialog pop-up to connect to the Dukeblue network. If you didn’t load a CA certificate in step 8, you’ll get the same warning dialog again. Once set up, there will be a configuration file containing your configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Dukeblue (or with whatever name you gave to the Wi-Fi connection in step 6 above). If you ever need to forget the Dukeblue network and start over, you can simply remove that file and repeat the process. If there is only one network connection defined in the NetworkManager configuration, it is the default for connections. If there are multiple connections defined, it’s not clear which connection will be used first. It is recommended to only have the one connection defined in NetworkManager and to manually attach to any other network(s) as needed. If you are still having difficulty connecting to Dukeblue, please consult with your local IT support, or contact the OIT Service Desk at 684-2200. Getting connected to Eduroam on an iPhone In order to connect to the secure network, adjustments will need to be made to your computer network settings. This process is simplified through the use of an installer. Follow these steps to configure your eduroam connection for an iPhone so you can take advantage of this layer of security. Installation 1. Open a browser on your iPhone and go to https://launch.dukeblue.duke.edu 2. Click Join Eduroam. 3. Enter your NetID and NetID password and click JoinNow. 4. Click Install in the top right-hand corner. 5. Enter your  iPhone passcode. 6. Click Install at the top right-hand corner of the page to install the Certificate. 7. Click Done in the top right-hand corner. 8. Verify you are connected to eduroam by checking your wireless settings. If you are still having difficulty connecting to eduroam, please consult with your local IT support, or contact the OIT Service Desk at 684-2200.

This tool allows users with no previous database experience to identify cohorts of patients and extract data from the DSR while maintaining patient privacy. The DEDUCE application is available at https://deduce.duhs.duke.edu/DSRQB/. To be granted access to DEDUCE, you must: Request a DEDUCE account. If the account request is submitted by someone other than your manager, your manager receives an email from Support@Duke with instructions for approving the account request. For users who do not have a "Manager" they should use that field to identify the person who reviews or supervises their work with research data - often this will be their PI. Attend DEDUCE Basics training. Before you attend training, your account request must be approved and processed. Allow 5 business days between when you submit your account request and the date of training. New DEDUCE users will access DEDUCE from a PACE workspace. PACE (Protected Analytics Computing Environment) is a virtual machine that provides a highly protected workspace where users can store and analyze sensitive data. PACE is not required to attend training for DEDUCE, but will be required for production access after training.To learn more about PACE, see article KB0025979 or visit the PACE Web site at https://pace.ori.duke.edu Log onto the Duke Health network, if you are not already connected.

To request additional monitoring (or monitoring removal) use the OIT – Monitoring Request form which can be found in ServiceNow in the Service Request Catalog. Log into Support@Duke > On the left under Self Service, click Service Request Catalog > Under the section Hosted Computing, click OIT - Monitoring Request > Complete the form and click Request Now on the top right. Placing a host in Maintenance Mode in Spectrum will suppress any alarms. If work is being done on a host then it should be placed in Maintenance Mode.  This can also be done via Enso or by contacting the Operations-Service Ops Center-OIT (either by a ServiceNow request or by phone). If a host requires a recurring maintenance schedule submit a request to Monitoring-OIT to have that configured. Alarms from monitored hosts are responded to by the Service Operations Center (SOC).  Notifications can be adjusted as necessary - submit a ServiceNow Request to Monitoring-OIT.  If there are particular steps that the SOC should take for a given alarm then the Service Management-OIT team will document those. Cacti offers graphing and trending data based on the information collected from each host.  Read access to Cacti is granted when requesting a VM through Clockworks. The following is the standard information that is available in Cacti: Linux Processes+ SNMP - TCP Connection Status ucd/net - CPU Usage (enhanced) ucd/net - Load Average (enhanced) ucd/net - Memory Usage (enhanced) ucd/net - TCP Counters ucd/net - TCP Current Established iostat - kBytes/sec iostat - Queue size iostat - Request size iostat - Requests/sec iostat - Times iostat - Utilisation RFC1213 Statistics SNMP - Get Mounted Partitions SNMP - Interface Statistics ucd/net - Get Monitored Partitions Host MIB - Processes SNMP - Get Processor Information The following steps describe the basic steps for accessing this information in Cacti: Log into Cacti - https://cacti.oit.duke.edu/cacti/graph_view.php?action=list From this view enter the host name in the search box: Click the Graph Title from the list presented to view the appropriate graphs Billing information can be located in Clockworks and displayed in several ways: From the main Clockworks page click on Provision in the Type column.  Scroll down to Additional Information and click on the Fund Code link.  This will display Billing History and all VMs associated with a given fund code.Going directly to https://clockworks.oit.duke.edu/fund_codes will allow you to enter a fund code and view Billing History and all VMs associated with the code entered.For Self Administered hosts billing information can be accessed by clicking directly on the VM name. The ability to install packages for Linux VMs is not enabled by default.  To install applications on a hosted Linux VM or to have this ability enabled, enter a ServiceNow Request with Systems-UNIX-OIT.  Application installation on Windows hosts is the responsibility of the owner. To request a reboot for a hosted VM enter a ServiceNow Request with either Systems-Windows-OIT or Systems-UNIX-OIT as appropriate. Patch Monkey Patch Monkey is the internally developed patch automation tool that is used to patch both Windows and Linux hosts (Note - this does not apply to hosts that are self-managed). Patch Monkey schedules and executes scripts on the host OS's that do the actual patching and verification. Patch Monkey creates a scheduled maintenance window in the monitoring application (Spectrum) just before it reboots a VM so no alarms are generated. The average maintenance window lasts 15 minutes for Linux hosts and 30 minutes for Windows hosts, but could extend to 4 hours depending on what is being patched. The maintenance windows are entirely time based; Patch Monkey creates them with a time limit and Spectrum does the alarm cleanup. Accessing Patch Monkey Anyone with a NetID can access Patch Monkey:  https://patchmonkey.oit.duke.edu/ Within Patch Monkey, on the calendar view the 'red text' patch windows are for test and dev hosts.   The 'green text' patch windows are for production hosts. To view a list of hosts or search for a particular host select 'Computers' from the menu. Patch Windows Every system that is in OIT's CMDB and marked as 'Active' with a sysadmin group of 'SSI-UNIX' or 'SSI-Windows' is in Patch Monkey, but may or may not have a patch window. Every VM created by clockworks that is not self administered will have a patch window automatically assigned. Sysadmins have the ability to unassign patch windows in special cases. Physical systems will need to be manually scheduled for a patch window after they've been appropriately added to the CMDB. Every system in patch monkey that is assigned to be patched will be patched every two weeks. Patch Window Email Notifications There will be two separate emails sent to members of the application support group for each patch window that contains hosts that their group is listed as supporting.  One email will be sent 24 hours prior to the patch window and another email shortly after the end of the patch window. Members of the application support group will only receive an email if a server listed for their group is in a particular patch window.  If multiple hosts are patched in the same window the emails to the application support group will contain a listing of the all the hosts for that group within that window; that way the application support group will only receive two emails for each patch window regardless of the number of hosts patched. The emails will be from patchmonkey@duke.edu. OIT uses our CMDB to match an application support group with each host.   The application support groups are based on the ServiceNow group membership.  So anyone who is a member of the application support groups' ServiceNow group will receive the notification emails. The email after the patching window will show one of three statuses for each host: Patched:  the host was successfully patched No Patches:  the host did not have any patches that needed to be installed Error:  either the attempt to patch or the reboot failed and the OIT operating system support teams have been notified to investigate the issue
prompt: Why did my server reboot when the status is ‘No Patches’?, completion:  There are two possible reasons: If your server is using reboot dependencies, the patching of another server may have forced the reboot of this server Windows servers can be placed in a ‘Reboot Required’ state after software is installed.  If this state is detected by Patch Monkey it will immediately reboot the server. One Time Request To Not Patch A Host If you would like to make a 'one time' request that your host not be patched during a particular patch window the request needs to be approved by the University IT Security Office (ITSO).   To make the request email the following information to security@duke.edu: host names the date and time that the patch window is scheduled to start the reason that you are requesting that the patch window be skipped If approved the host will not be patched in that patch window and will have the patches applied in the next regularly scheduled patch window. Emergency Patching Emergency patching occurs if there has been a security vulnerability that the University IT Security Office (ITSO) has determined is critical enough to warrant immediate attention.  The OIT OS teams will coordinate the patching and notifications will be sent out. Questions About Patch Monkey Email patchmonkey@duke.edu The University IT Security Office scans all public IP addresses monthly looking for vulnerabilities present in OIT hosts.  Any vulnerabilities found will generate a ticket requesting that the issues are remediated.  The following are basic guidelines from the University IT Security Office to help ensure that your host is protected: Always use strong, complex passwordsor passphrases for every account (especially for service accounts) and change them on a regular basis. Ensure that hosts recieve security updates and patches regularly. Use a host based firewall configured for default deny. This is especially important for administrative services such as SSH, RDP, and administrative access to a web application. A full list of Server Security Standards can be found here. Requests for the implementation of new firewall rules can be entered via a form in Cartographer.  Following the link below and filling out the request will create a ticket for the Security team to review the request and for the Networking team to implement the change. https://cartographer.oit.duke.edu/firewall/requests/ In the event that the System Administrators (users who are able to access VMs with elevated administrative privileges) need to be added and/or removed then a ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-Vmware Storage and Backups-OIT team.  Updates to the System Administrator list will need the approval of the current Owner of the VM (most VMs in Clockworks have an associated ServiceNow group and the manager of that group is considered the owner of the VM.  In the event that there is no associated ServiceNow group, the owner is considered the primary contact listed). In the event that the ownership of a VM needs to be transferred then a ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-Vmware Storage and Backups-OIT team.  Transfers of ownership will require the approval of the new and former owners of the VM. In the event that a VM needs to be moved to a new network a ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-UNIX-OIT team or Systems-Windows-OIT team.  If the host is self-managed then a ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-Vmware Storage and Backups-OIT team. If a VM is transitioning from being Self-managed to OIT-managed then the standard procedure involves the rebuilding of the VM to meet with OIT standards.  A ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-UNIX-OIT team or Systems-Windows-team. If a VM is transitioning from being OIT-managed to Self-managed then a ServiceNow task should be opened with the Systems-UNIX-OIT team or Systems-Windows-OIT team. Self Administration Clockworks https://clockworks.oit.duke.edu/ Clockworks is OIT's VM Automation application.  Clockworks can be used to request new VM's and also contains basic information on the host, including: System Information (Base Memory, Processors, Disk Size, OS, IPs and Mac Addresses) VMware Information (Folder, UUID, Tools Status, Location, Service Level) Backups and Monitoring (Notes if this is enabled or not) Business Information (Fund code, Server Function, Application, Criticality, Hours of Support, Service Manager and Owner, App Support Group, System Administration, Secure Project and Patch Window) System Administrators Billing information has been moved from Clockworks to Exchequer. A hosted VM can be accessed in the following method: Log into Clockworks Click VMs in the banner to list all VMs that you have access to: Click the appropriate host name: In the VMware section click the link labled View VM in vSphere: This will launch the vShpere Web Client.  Enter the appropriate credentials to login. Select the appropriate VM and click the Summary tab.  From here you can click the thumbnail console above "Launch Remote Console" to access the VM console in a pop out window.  Clicking on Actions (next to the host name at the top) will give you access to Power options (Power On, Power Off, Suspend and Reset): More information can be found here. Decommissioning a Virtual Machine Decommissioning a host can be done through Clockworks.  This is an automated process that will also remove any monitoring, backups etc. that may have been in place. Locate the Virtual Machine in Clockworks Click Delete: Click Request Delete: The deletion Request ServiceNow ticket number will be displayed at the top of the screen: Please note that while the Virtual Machine may show as being deleted fairly quickly in Clockworks, the host is not actually deleted for 7 days.  If the host has been deleted accidentally it should be able to be restored within that time frame.

prompt: Who should I contact to get access to DISCERN?, completion:  DISCERN (Duke Integrated Subject Cohort and Enrollment Research Network) is maintained by the Analytics Center of Excellence (ACE), specifically the ACE Research Team. DISCERN’s hybrid framework for identifying real-time clinical events housed in HL7 messages complements the traditional approach of using retrospective warehoused data. DISCERN is helpful in instances when the required clinical data may not be loaded into the warehouse and thus must be captured real-time during patient care from Admission, Transfer, Discharge, Lab Results, Lab Orders, Diagnoses, Scheduling and Medication Order and Administration information. To request access, please go to GetIT. Please make sure you put DISCERN in the name of your request. Service Desk: For users with questions or requesting assistance for DISCERN, please create and assign a ticket to ACE DISCERN-DHTS. Using the Duke@Work My Pay Tab, employees can deduct funds from pay and have those funds added to a Flex account associated with their DukeCard.  Through Duke@Work employees can: Establish a one-time or recurring deduction. Change previously established deductions. End previously established deductions. Employees should remember the following when working with Flex deductions: Employees can access the deductions page throughout the pay period; however, changes cannot be made while Corporate Payroll Services is executing a payroll run. Employees will receive a message indicating the system is locked during the payroll run. For biweekly employees, the deduction is taken once a month and is deducted from the second payment in a month. Once a payroll is run, all changes to DukeCard Flex account deductions are final and cannot be changed until the next pay period. Money is available in the DukeCard Flex account no later than the first day for the month after the deductions are taken. Recurring deductions can be established for one year.  The year is based upon the pay period in which the deduction is established or changed. Employees will receive email notifications as follows: o   When a new deduction is established or when a deduction is changed. o   Prior to the last deduction indicating that the upcoming deduction will be their last. For more information about the DukeCard Flexible spending account, review the FLEX Account FAQ or contact the DukeCard Office at 919-684-5800 or dukecard@duke.edu. Establishing a DukeCard Flex Payroll Deduction Log into Duke@Work – work.duke.edu and go to the “My Info” page and the “My Pay” tab. On the “My Pay” page, select “Deduction for DukeCard Flex Spending” to access the deductions. Once on the Deduction Page, select “Create Deduction” to begin. Enter the requested information about the deduction.  Once all the information is entered, select “Save Deduction” to begin the save process or “Cancel” to exit without saving. A pop-up box appears with important terms and conditions.  Please review all information CAREFULLY.  A deduction summary is included.  If all information is correct, “check” the box authorizing the deduction and select “Save”.  Select “Cancel” to exit without saving information. A confirmation screen displays indicating a successful update.  Additionally, a summary of current deductions and a running total of deductions from each payment for the current calendar year displays.  Please note:  this will not display information until the payroll for the pay period impacted is run by Corporate Payroll Services.  Upon final review, if there are errors, select “Change Deduction” or “Stop Deduction” as appropriate. Select the “red X” in the upper right corner of the screen to exit. Changing a DukeCard Flex Payroll Deduction Log into Duke@Work – work.duke.edu and go to the “My Info” page and the “My On the “My Pay” page, select “Deduction for DukeCard Flex Spending” to access the deductions. If deductions are already established, a summary of the deductions will display.  Select “Change Deduction” to make a change.

Select the “red X” in the upper right corner of the screen to exit. Please note:  While not recommended, the system will allow multiple deductions using different date ranges.  Since  each deduction is established as a separate entry and each deduction can be established for a year, the net effect may result in  deductions being established for an extended period.   The screen shot below demonstrates this deduction scenario.  To remove unwanted deductions, follow the stops outline in the Stop Deduction section of this reference.

This article contains an overview of common tools, as well as their appropriate uses and limitations, used within the Maestro Care application for clinical documentation and alerting. It also includes the process, tools, and forms for requesting these tools. This article is useful when making optimization requests. Intended Audiences Care Redesign Teams Nursing and Physician Champions Super Users Users authorized to submit enhancement requests on behalf of their departments Click Procedure for instructions on how to submit requests and needed forms. Common Tools Tool Limitations Request Details BPA BPAs (Best Practice Advisories) notify you when a set of criteria is true. They alert you to consider the criteria that triggered the notification and potentially change your course of action. BPAs are typically not considered hard stops since you can cancel or override a BPA with an acknowledgement reason. BPAs can only be triggered by certain actions with the patient’s chart, based on user type. Once triggered, follow-up actions can be defined to prompt you to place or discontinue and order, take them to a particular activity, send an InBasket message, etc. Not all pop-ups in Maestro Care are BPAs. There are several other alert types for particular activities like Order Validation points, Case Entry Rules, Case Log Events, Transfer Activity Events, etc. The BPA workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Notes and Smart Tools Using Notes activity and SmartTools, you enter Progress notes, Discharge Summaries, History and Physical notes, Procedure and Consult notes, and other types of notes into the patient’s record. Requests can include any of the following elements: Note Types – Must be approved at Stakeholder groups and then approved by HIM for inclusion in the Legal Medical Record. All requests should include the following information: The use of the Note Type (for which patients/situations will be the note type be used)
prompt: Who should have access to create notes of these types, completion:  Which Notes tab should the notes be filed to SmartTexts/SmartPhrases – Pulls pre-defined text into notes. Information required: Specify SmartText or SmartPhrase Exact formatting (font, etc.) Other SmartTools to be included SmartLinks – Pulls in information from other parts of the chart (labs, flowsheet information, demographics). Information required: If pulling in flowsheet information, the request needs the exact flowsheet row or template. For lab links, the base and/or common name are required. Examples of other links that work similarly if possible. SmartLists – Presents options in a pre-defined list from which you can choose. SmartLists can be layered (lists within lists). Information required: List options Multi-select or Single select The HIM group completes a specific form for any new Note Type requests. FYI flags FYI Flags share pertinent clinical and demographic equipment for patients and can cross encounters. All FYI Flag requests should be approved through Stakeholder groups and the DHTS FYI Flag workgroup. Passive FYI Flags (those that do not generate a BPA, banner, or other secondary notification) should not be considered as they are not highly visible on the chart. Information needed for FYI Flag requests:
prompt: What secondary notification means are in place, completion:  The FYI Flag workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Synopses Synopses are available for Inpatient, Outpatient, and Beacon specifically. Inpatient Synopses enable you to view different types of patient data in one location. You can view this data in one of the following three ways: Events view - Displays all events that occurred for a patient within a timeframe. By default, this timeframe is the most recent shift, as defined in the department record where you are logged in. There are two versions of this view: Events By Time - Displays events grouped by the date that they were documented. These events appear in the order they took place. Events By Type - Displays events grouped by the type of event that occurred (for example, labs, medications, or procedure Notes). Current Status view - Displays nutritional information and problems that were noted for the patient. By default, this view displays data that occurred within the past 24 hours. Graph view - Displays patient data from documentation flowsheet rows so that you can easily compare the values. You can graph up to ten different flowsheet rows at a time by selecting the hyperlink for the flowsheet row that appears under the graph. If you place your cursor over a time in the Events view, a blue line appears on the graph at the time the event occurred. A similar activity, Outpatient Synopsis, is available in outpatient settings and shows a longitudinal view of a patients lab results, medications, procedures, vitals, and other relevant details over months or years of visits. Currently Inpatient does not have any Synopsis built and any limitations are currently unknown. The Synopses workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Education The education activity is available for both inpatient and outpatient.  It is the only place to document education where the learner, readiness, response, and method are documented for regulatory compliance. Maestro Care inpatient team builds the education templates. Therefore, if one does not exist or is not adequate, the Maestro Care team can build/fix it. A widget and report is available for the overview/summary report. The widget displays current education templates applied on the patient’s chart. The report link within the widget displays details about the education including the topic, point, details about the education point, and learning progress. The Patient Education and Family Governance Council must approve any patient education material. Handoff Reports Handoff reports allow clinicians to communicate important time-sensitive information between shifts. Handoff reports are specialty-specific, so you write and review reports that contain information only relevant to yourself. Unlike Notes, handoff reports might not remain part of the patient's legal medical record. Data in the handoff reports is purged after discharge. You write handoff reports in the Handoff sidebar of the Patient Lists activity. When a sidebar is opened, select a service so that only sections relevant to your specialty appear.
prompt: When you start your shift, you can review existing handoff reports in the Patient Lists activity and filter them by service to show only reports related to your specialty. You can also print specialty-specific handoff reports for all your patients to have on rounds., completion:  Currently, handoff reports are for provider services and do not include nursing or other ancillary teams. Access to handoff reports is granted to almost all inpatient clinicians, including students by security points. This is also considered an inpatient tool as it is a patient list activity. The Handoff Reports workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Overview Reports Reports accessed from Patient Lists and Summary activities contain information gathered from the patient’s record in print groups (widgets) that can be configured in different ways. Information needed for request: Where the report is accessed (Patient Lists, Summary activity, Sidebar, etc.)
prompt: What information displays in this report:, completion:  Lab data must contain base/common name of the exact labs. Medications include the Pharmaceutical class, the drug, the exact drug names, or order number. Flow sheet requests include the exact flow sheet row or template for which the data is being pulled. Linked reports have the report name in the request. Widgets that graph have the interval values. The Overview Reports workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Care Plans A multidisciplinary team (nurses, therapists, and other ancillary staff) involved in treatment can document and update the care plan, based on the patient's current condition. A clinician can apply a care plan template, which contains problems, goals, and interventions, but each care plan should be individualized to the patient. Care plan problems include discrete goals for a patient that clinicians use to track and evaluate patient progress toward resolving a patient's problem. A goal is an objective that the patient's care team wants to reach in regards to patient care. Patient goals contain interventions that you can carry out to meet the patient's goals. An intervention is a specific task scheduled to be completed to relieve a patient's problem. You can document on either the goal, or, if a patient does not meet a goal, a variance. A variance is documented when something other than the scheduled intervention occurs, such as the patient refusing care or you deciding that the intervention is not necessary. Care plans are currently used only in inpatient settings. Added manually by clinicians or Care Plans can be suggested by BPAs from orders or flowsheet documentation. Care Plan interventions can automatically add education templates. Care Plan interventions can add work list tasks (there are frequency limitations so some requests must be tested). Flowsheet rows can be embedded in Care Plans to provide access to document. Smart text can be added to goals for individualizing goal.
prompt: Can add hyperlinks to reference material., completion:  The Care Plans workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. System Lists System Lists identify a set of admitted patients that meet certain criteria. Patients are not included on a System List after they are discharged. System Lists are built by analysts and cannot be modified by the end user. Columns for System Lists are determined in a System List Folder. System Lists can be created by using a particular order as a filter, like a specific consult order. The most basic System Lists are used to capture all patients on each hospital unit. A set of System Lists are collected within a System List folder, for example Hospital Units or Hospital Provider Consult Orders. The Willow Team builds and maintains many pharmacy criteria System Lists. System Lists can be filtered by procedure order types, like physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), or respiratory orders, which capture all patients of a particular order type. Assigned providers and provider teams can also be used as a System List filter. You can also apply secondary filtering to a System List. These filters include or exclude that particular filter item. Age is a common secondary filter, with orders of a specific order type split by age group, for example pediatrics or adult PT. You can also apply a secondary filter on an answer to a question or a response in a flow sheet row. A filter on a particular data point can be created if that data item can be captured in a column. After a data item is configured to appear in a column, it can be used as a secondary filter for a System List. You can use System Lists to configure your MyLists and Shared Lists by configuring a MyList folder with the appropriate columns and copying a System List into your MyList folder. The setting that makes the MyList into a Share List is also in the MyList folder. The columns that are available is set in a security profile. System Lists are available only for inpatient mode orders. Columns for a System List are set at the folder level, so you cannot configure a System List within a folder. That customization must be done when the System List is copied to a MyList. System Lists are designed for inpatient use, including emergency room (ER) and operating room (OR) areas. They are available for use in HOD departments as well. The System Lists workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Order Sets Order Sets are groups of orders related to an event or condition, such as an admission, surgery, or diagnosis for inpatient use, that are commonly ordered together. Order sets frequently have default values so orders can be placed more efficiently for conditions where the same orders are placed for most patients. You can save multiple versions of order sets so you can preconfigure your own answers to order-specific questions or preselect specific orders. This allows you to save a different version of the order set to specifically match common practices to specific problems or patient populations. The goal of order sets should be to standardize care according to the best evidenced-based practices and to remove unnecessary tests, studies, medications, and procedures that do not improve care. Restrictions can account for differences between hospitals or in special populations, such as pediatrics or gender-based differences. It is crucial to know any differences between hospitals that cannot be standardized, such as differences in medications, imaging, diagnostic, or laboratory studies. Order sets should cover the most common orders and help place orders needed for core measures such as VTE prophylaxis. Order sets are not intended to cover all orders needed for admission as the Admission Navigator also allows you to convert home medications to inpatient medications. Order sets for procedures or surgeries are preconfigured with phase of care to help you place orders ahead of time with the correct phases of care so the order can be released at the appropriate time. Order sets are designed for inpatient use. SmartSets are designed for outpatient settings and can contain diagnose, SmartTexts, and SmartForms. Changes made after an order set is released cause you to re-save your own versions, since changes to questions and other configurations require resetting parts of the order, which also affects your version. You can share versions, but other uses can’t modify shared versions as a template without creating a new copy. Instead, they can modify the other user’s order set version for each individual patient. Order sets need to be reviewed every 3 years. Not as many users take the time to create their own user order sets, which would allow for them to answer the majority of the required questions in the order set. The more complicated order sets become (with restrictions or order questions), the more maintenance is required for the order set if changes are needed. The Order Sets workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Flow sheets Flow sheets assist in documentation needs. From a flow sheet row, you can trigger a Work List task, fire a BPA, show documentation within a Smart Phrase or Smart Text, create a PAF column, and start the charging process. It is recommended that you standardize flow sheets across inpatient and outpatient settings and across specialties (for example PT, OT, Speech, etc.) for transparency. You cannot trigger a Work List based on specific values within a flowsheet. The Flowsheets workgroup and stakeholder groups review, approve, and prioritize requests. Procedure After the Duke hospitals (Duke University Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital, and Duke Regional Hospital) and operational groups (such as CPC and PMMC) vet each request, submit a formal request by completing the following steps: If this is a BPA request complete the BPA Request form and save it to your local computer. These additional forms will help guide you with completing the BPA request.

prompt: Why are we moving to contactless DukeCards?, completion:  We are moving to contactless cards for as part of a larger project to adopt contactless technology across all Duke campuses.  Contactless readers are more responsive, cause less wear and tear on cards, provide secure encrypted transactions and pave the way for future contactless applications such as iPhone or Android apps.  Contactless cards can be used on campus exterior doors, laundry rooms, vending and snack machines and dining locations.
prompt: How do I use the new contactless door reader?, completion:  Contactless readers have a PIN pad; PIN numbers are not required to enter buildings except for the campus data centers. You will see the white Blackboard (Bb) logo lit on the bottom right side of the reader when it is operational. The contactless chip is located to the left of the chapel image.  For the best read, remove the card from the holder and touch the card to the top 2/3ds of the reader face (PIN pad).  You will see a green light when your card is accepted. If your tap is not accepted at the reader, you will see a red light.  You may not have access to the door you are attempting to enter.
prompt: Can I punch a hole in my contactless DukeCard for use with another card holder or lanyard?, completion:  It is very important that you do NOT punch holes in your card! You may damage the contactless chip.
prompt: Can I still swipe my contactless card at campus locations?, completion:  Yes, your contactless card also contains a Mag stripe which you can swipe at any location. I need to access campus data centers or Health System facilities – do I need a new contactless card? The Telcom Building on West Campus and the Fitz East Data Center are equipped with contactless door readers. You will use your contactless card with a PIN number for access when those buildings are complete.  You may set your PIN number at the DukeCard My DukeCard website (https://dco31.oit.duke.edu/mydukecard/).  This PIN number is specific to the user who set it up; DukeCard does not have a record of your PIN and there is no "master code". If you need Health System building access, please come to the DukeCard Office to get a contactless/Prox card.
prompt: Who do I contact if I have a problem with my new contactless card?, completion:  If you have a problem with your contactless card, please call the DukeCard Office at (919) 684-5800 or email dukecard@duke.edu.  Please note the color of the light on the card reader before you call so we can more quickly diagnose the problem. This page includes Office Activation information for Duke students.  If you are a faculty or staff member, visit the Faculty/Staff Office Activation Page. Which version of Office is right for me?
prompt: What if I already graduated and forgot to get my graduation copy?, completion:  While enrolled at Duke - Office 365 - Current Duke students are entitled to download Microsoft Office for their personally owned computers and mobile devices through the Duke Office 365 license. Under this license, Office software can be installed on up to five computers and mobile devices simultaneously.  This version activates with Duke netID authentication, so it will stop working when you leave Duke. About to Graduate - Graduation Copy - Students are entitled to a free, perpetual graduation license of Microsoft Office, which will allow the installation of Office on one Mac or PC. This license will work after a student graduates. It is recommended that students only access the graduation copy during their final semester since only one download and installation of one version is permitted. The recommendations for which edition of Office (2010 or later for Windows) to install are as follows: If users in your organization depend on existing extensions to Office, such as ActiveX controls, third-party add-ins, in-house solutions built on previous versions of Office, or 32-bit versions of programs that interface directly with Office, we recommend that you install 32-bit Office 2010 or 2013 (the default installation) on computers that are running both 32-bit and 64-bit supported Windows operating systems.  If some users in your organization are Excel expert users who work with Excel spreadsheets that are larger than 2 gigabytes (GB), they can install the 64-bit edition of Office. In addition, if you have in-house solution developers, we recommend that those developers have access to the 64-bit edition of Office so that they can test and update your in-house solutions on the 64-bit edition of Office.

Various versions will be available on the Students->Microsoft tab.  Note that this page is not accessible after you lose your student affiliation. After you check out, you'll need to download and install Microsoft Office within 30 days (or before graduating, whichever is sooner) or you will lose access to the download permanently. The graduation copy is a retail version of Office 365.  You'll need to sign in with a personal Microsoft account to activate, so if you don't already have one, you must create one.  Do not use Duke credentials to sign into this copy of Office. The Extended Access Guarantee is an optional service provided by Kivuto that will allow you to access the key and the download through the site for 2 years rather than 30 days for a fee.  If you write down your key and back up your downloaded installer file, this is not necessary.  If you leave Duke, it does not matter if you purchased the extended access guarantee because the site uses netID for authentication. The graduation copy distribution page is netID-protected, so you will not be able to access it.  For this reason, it is important to access the graduation copy during your final semester at Duke.

ACD - Automatic Call Distribution ACD’s are customizable voice applications that “queue callers” when agents are not immediately available to answer calls. As calls enter the queue the application distributes them across an available pool of agents. ACD’s require that at least one agent be logged-in and “ready” to answer calls in order to receive calls from the queue. Supervisors can monitor queue and agent activity from their desktops and listen to live calls. These applications offer a host of real-time and historical reports that can assist the supervisor with day to day call flow management and agent productivity. Provide your customers with a single telephone number to dial Determine how calls are distributed and routed to a pool of agents Reduce or eliminate abandoned calls (hang-ups) by providing queuing or announcements Process incoming calls more effectively Generate real-time and historical reports and agent performance metrics Know when to add staff to handle peak calling periods Pricing FY2018- 2019 Specialty Service rates currently excluded from the VOIP rate structure: One time ACD setup fee - $715 (per agent / supervisor position) ACD annual support fee - $352 (per agent / supervisor position) Lead Time ACD applications are customizable to fit your individual departmental needs. Be prepared to summarize your business application or what you are hoping to accomplish by using an ACD script as well as the time-frame needed. Budget at least (30) business days from final design and approval to implement and “go live” with your new application. Call Flows Call flows are a visual representation of the ACD design. You will be asked to consider how you would like the application to route calls during normal business hours, after hours, during holidays and in emergency situations. OIT can assist you in designing your call flows including on-hold announcements, over flow voice mail boxes, hours of operation etc. Planning your call flows properly ensures that your customers are triaged and handled appropriately. Announcements These are customizable to fit your work flow and may include a main greeting, menu options, after hours & holiday announcements. Announcements are professionally recorded and applied to the ACD application. OIT can assist you with the wording based on your call flows. * Please note that recordings can take (7-10) business days to complete and are done once weekly. Agents & Supervisors ACD Agent and supervisor log-in credentials are created based on the number of personnel you wish to answer queued calls. Agents can be configured to a specific individual (NetID) or can be generic so that it can be shared within a group. Note that each agent log-in credential can only be used by one individual at a time. Finesse (Agent log-in tool) Finesse is a Cisco Systems web based tool that ACD agents and supervisors use to log-in and take calls from the application. Users that access Finesse from a Health System PIN station will need to request access via each individuals PIN account through the DHTS service desk. University agents will access finesse via the web URL. University and Health System Non-PIN station agents may access Finesse via the URL above Health System agents will receive access to Finesse through their PIN account. Use the verbiage below when submitting your request to the DHTS service desk requesting access.

Check out the OIT recommendations to plan your cellular service before you leave. International travelers should plan their international cell phone use before their trip to make sure they will have cellular service coverage at their destination and to avoid accidentally incurring thousands of dollars in unplanned roaming charges. See the Related Help Articles for our advice on using your US cell service internationally or activating temporary cell service for your trip. Besides these general recommendations, OIT maintains country-by-country information on US carrier coverage and in-country service options (link is external) in the most popular Duke travel destinations. Whether you use your U.S. service or activate service at your destination, OIT recommends that you: Turn off data/roaming whenever you are not actively using your device for email, maps or other applications. Apps can use up expensive data, even when you are not using your phone. Use a trusted WiFi network instead of cellular data whever possible. Consider Skype, WebEx or similar apps to make cheap calls or video conference while traveling. Secure your phone with a strong passcode, encryption and remote-wipe capabilities to protect your data if your device is lost or stolen. And, install VPN on your phone for better security and privacy on public W-Fi networks. Using your existing service typically means you can send/receive calls, text messages and data from the moment you arrive at your destination, and can easily reach and be reached by colleagues and family at your existing phone number. It will be more inconvenient (and expensive) to call local businesses and colleagues or for them to reach you; and, voice calls, text messages and Internet/data can be expensive, especially if travelers do not activate a global plan for their trip. Using your existing U.S. cellular phone and service is usually the best option for short-duration trips and for occasional or first-time travelers. If you have a Duke department-paid AT&T or Verizon cell phone: inform your departmental business manager of your trip and request they activate a global plan before your departure. Be sure to verify your destination is covered in Duke's special negotiated global plan and that your phone will have coverage and service. Find out more about Duke-paid AT&T and Verizon global cell plans.If you have a personally-paid AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon cell phone: contact your carrier, preferably at least a week before you travel, and verify: Carrier global rates: Some countries may be covered through an optional global plan, providing discounted voice and text message rates, and typically providing an allowance for international data service. In countries outside your carrier's plan -- or if you do not activate a plan -- your phone may still work, but could quickly incur rates of as much as $5.00 or more per minute for voice calls and upwards of $20.00 or more per megabyte downloaded. Coverage maps: Cellular service is widespread but not ubiquitous, especially in developing countries. Verify the cities/towns you will visit have service on your carrier's international coverage map. Phone compatibility: Different carriers worldwide use a range of technologies and frequencies for cellular services. Many recent smartphones from Apple, Samsung and other manufacturers have "worldband" technology that works in many countries, but you need to verify your phone will work. If not, ask your carrier if they offer a rental phone option. AT&T and T-Mobile phones use the popular worldwide GSM standard and often have the broadest global compatibility. Many modern Verizon and Sprint smartphones are "world-phones" with similar capabilities for international roaming; however, both carriers also offer CDMA-only phones that are more restricted internationally. Alternatively, some travelers choose to purchase service from a local cellular carrier when they reach their destination. These can have lower rates for in-country calls and more generous data packages than using a U.S. carrier’s service internationally; and, it will be easier to make and receive calls in-country. Activating local service requires significantly more time, effort and research than using your existing carrier, however, and makes sending/receiving calls from the U.S. more difficult. Generally, this option is appropriate only for Duke travelers who will be abroad for an extended period; for heavy data users; and for more experienced travelers. In most countries, travelers can purchase prepaid service for a nominal fee; this will include a SIM card along with an allotment of voice messages, text messages and data. The SIM card is inserted into an existing phone (in place of the existing U.S. carrier’s SIM card, if any) to provide access to a local carrier’s network. Which provider? As in the U.S., most countries have multiple cellular networks. (See OIT’s country-by-country reference information (link is external) on carriers in popular Duke travel destinations.) Typically, you will find: One or two large, dominant carriers (similar to Verizon and AT&T in the US) that have very good nationwide networks including good coverage in rural areas, but this coverage often comes with a premium price. Some of these carriers restrict services offered to prepaid users. Smaller competitors (think T-Mobile in the US) that focus on serving major cities, sometimes differentiating themselves with faster 3G/LTE speeds and aggressive prices; however, their coverage in rural areas can be poor or non-existent, or could incur roaming charges. In many countries, mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) resell provider service at a discount in a prepaid model. Some of these providers, which often cater to immigrants or expatriate workers, offer better foreign-language service and support than the national providers; in many countries, this can include robust English-language support. MVNOs sometimes are limited to slower 2G/3G speeds, and travelers should check the national network the MVNO uses to compare coverage and reliability. Compatible phone? Verify that your phone is compatible with the LTE/4G, 3G, or 2G/GSM networks used at your destination. “Worldband” phones are usually widely supported, but networks vary by country. Check with your phone manufacturer or existing U.S. carrier for the frequencies/bands supported by your phone; these can vary by carrier even for the same phone. Unlocked phone? If your existing cell phone was purchased in the U.S., it may be “locked” to your current carrier. Your U.S. carrier must agree to “unlock” your phone to allow its use on a different carrier. Typically, this is done in-person at a retail location in the U.S. before your trip. Buy a phone? If your phone is not compatible or unlocked, an inexpensive basic cell phone or smartphone can be purchased before your trip or upon arrival. This can be useful for travelers desiring local phone service in addition to their U.S. coverage and phone number. Coverage? Check these carriers’ coverage maps, consult recent travelers, or check with colleagues at your destination to choose the best carrier for your trip. Where to buy? Cell phone stores/kiosks are often available in international airports, often before clearing customs. Most carriers list retail locations on their web site. You may need to be fluent in the local language or have help translating to navigate the purchase and set-up of your service. Need to add value? If you exhaust your voice, text or data allowance, you can usually add more value at your carrier’s store, or via convenience stores, post offices, tobacconists or other retailers. Find out how to “top up” your service when activating your phone. Restrictions? In many countries, a foreign passport or national identity card is required to buy and register cellular service. In a few countries, non-citizens are prohibited from purchasing cell service or bringing some communications technologies (like satellite phones) into the country. Check the rules applicable to your destination before you travel. Also, some providers block voice over IP applications like Skype; check with your provider if you plan to use these applications.
prompt: What is a virtual private network?, completion:  A virtual private network (VPN) allows for a secure connection into a private network over the public network. Although you are connecting from a remote location, the VPN makes the connection work as if you were on a direct connection into our network.

Software (available for students on the software site) Microsoft Office Repair Costs of a Laptop Over Time The Duke Technology Center warranty also covers breaks and spills.  The cost to repair a laptop increases greatly over time because of the limited availability of parts from manufacturers. Units with limited warranties or warranties shorter than three years that also do not include software support and a break and spill warranty can cost more in the long run because of the high cost of repair if the machine malfunctions. Duke Computer Repair Average Costs for the Most Commonly Replaced Components Part Average Cost Labor LCD screen $300 - $750 $100/hour Laptop motherboard Hard drive $89 - $150 Keyboard $59 As shown by the cost of replacement parts and labor, purchasing a computer through the Duke Technology Center can pay for itself many times over.

Storage & Backup In addition to the optional levels of TSM backups, we now have Veeam VM based backups.  These VM based backups provide a full copy of each VM that is snapped every other day.   This backup is intdened only for disaster and/or complete corruption of a VM recoveries.  To be able to recover individual files or partial VM data recoveries, TSM is the solution as Veeam does not have that level of capabilities. 25 Gb of Storage with onsite TSM backups is included in the cost of each standard configuration above with the exception of Platinum.  Due to the nature of VMs expected for Platinum VMs (All Flash Storage), each Platinum VM configuration comes with a base of 250 Gb of storage. Additional storage for each type is as follows (all in $/Gb/Yr) Storage with no TSM Backup $0.50 $0.18 Storage + onsite TSM Backup $.84 $0.59 $0.27 Storage + onsite and offsite TSM Backup $.88 $0.63 $0.31 System Administration In addition to the Standard VMware Administration, the following OS System Administration levels are offered: Central System Administration Level No additional charge (Default) 8/5 Standard OIT-SI OS System Administration $175/year 24/7 Standard OIT-SI OS System Administration $350/year 8/5 Webhosting OIT-SI System Administration $425/year 24/7 Webhosting OIT-SI System Administration $600/year *pricing updated 10/1/2018 Billing Payments will be charged to the Fund code provided on a monthly basis.  Fund codes will be charged a single entry for all VMs assigned to that code per month at a rate of 1/12 the annual cost.  To see details (per server cost) of your fund code, go to the Fund Code link in Clockworks.   Pricing is reviewed annually in the fall.  It is unexpected that rates will increase due to the typical cost reduction seen in hardware infrastructure over time.

Resolving this issue involves using keyboard shortcuts to bring the companion window back to the front and placing it in a visible location. It is not known if a permanent solution will be developed to resolve this issue. In Resolute Professional Billing (PB), it is possible for the PB Claim Edit Workqueue companion window to become hidden in the background in certain scenarios involving multiple monitors. The primary symptom of this issue is that clicking the hyperlink to open a claim edit workqueue companion appears to do nothing. Cause This issue is caused by a problem in the interaction between the Citrix virtual machine environment and the local workstation when there is a change in monitor configuration. This may occur when a laptop user who is logged into Epic docks, undocks, or attaches a monitor cable.
prompt: When a user experiences the behavior detailed above, the following will restore the Claim Edit Workqueue Companion window:, completion:  Log out of Epic, then log back into Epic. Open the Claim Edit workqueue previously open, and click the hyperlink to open the Claim Edit Workqueue Companion. If it does not appear, press Alt, then press Spacebar. Press 'M', then press the Left Arrow. Move your mouse to center of the screen. You should now see an outline of the Companion window. Left-Click to place the companion window. The window will now be visible.

prompt: What is an LDAP connection?, completion:  The Application uses LDAP to perform an authenticated bind to the Active Directory using a specified username, password, and "connection string". The connection string is made up of the LDAP server's name, and the fully-qualified path of the OU object where the user specified is located. The connection string begins with the URI LDAP:// - For the server name, you use the name of an LDAP designated DNS entry for the domain. example: "dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636". Which equates to: LDAPS://dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636/ (Depending on application design and configuration. Always consult your manual.) If unencrypted 389 or 3268 works but SSL is not connecting properly, make sure you have the DHE root cert registered as a trusted root for your application.  The trusted root can be downloaded from https://vwp-trec2.dhe.duke.edu/certsrv/certcarc.asp. Next is the fully qualified path of the OU object where the binding user is located. We are using the "DHTS_ServiceAccount" account and the domain's name is "dhe ". The "DHTS_ServiceAccount" account is located in the "OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu" OU in the DHE domain. The fully qualified DN for the "Users" OU is: “CN=NETID,OU=UserAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu”. Combine the LDAPS://dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636/ with the fully qualified path to the OU where the binding user is located (like, say, LDAPS://dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636/CN=DHTS_ServiceAccount,OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu) and basically you've got your "connection string". You should always use the domain's designated LDAP name in the connection string as opposed to the name of a single domain controller or IP Address. The difference is that the domain's LDAP name will resolve to any of the active IP addresses of any domain controller designated in the LDAP in the domain. You're not reliant on any single domain controller to be up and running for the membership provider to work, and the name will resolve to any active DC in the domain. Pointing to a single DC or IP is a single point of failure if that particular DC becomes inactive. Examples of LDAP connections are provided later on. Requirements Each application has a specific setup process. Each vendor has a unique way to establish the LDAP connection string. The LDAP definitions can either be set in a text .ini file, or the app uses a GUI interface. Whichever method is used; the connection string should resolve back to the correct LDAP connection string required for AD. The LDAP must point to a specific Load Balancing LDAP entry, and never to a single IP or DC name. For SSL you may also need a trusted root Certificate installed in the server. Service account It is advisable to use a unique Service Account for setting up the LDAP connection for the application. Service accounts can be requested through Service now refer to the KB article KB0016703: Basic LDAP settings Please use one of the two recommended Load balancing LDAPs used on the F5 load balancer. They are: "dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636" - for production, preferably use port 636 as it is more secure; or use: " dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:389" - for testing purposes only. Please replace any existing LDAP entry for "dhe.duke.edu:389 –or- ldap.dhe.duke.edu:389" and replace that with "dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu:636". What that means is that usually port 389 and 3268 allows clear text in the data and port 636 and 3269 encrypts this data and is more secure. This is a requirement from the ISO office. Please do not use any LDAP using port 389 unless there is a written consent from the ISO office. Authentication domain: dhe.duke.edu LDAP Server Name: dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu Server Port: 636 NOTE: This is a MUST. Port 389 (Testing only) should never be used and may no longer be available sometime in the near future. Require Secure Communication (SSL) = YES LDAP Search base: "DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu" Login id should be samAccountName search string for users: (&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=<user account>)) search string for groups: (&(objectCategory=group)(objectClass=group)( sAMAccountName=<group name>)) Based on the application requirements this could also be: givenname -or- sAMAccountName LDAP ports available There are 4 ports set up for LDAP; they are: 389 and 3268 (GC) - For test purposes only 636 and 3269 (GC) - For production and may require the LDAP Root certificate Test the LDAP There are many ways to check if the LDAP is functioning correctly, and the best method is to follow the manufacturing Vendor’s recommendations. Usually a “Connect” or “Test” button on the GUI. There is also the Windows LDP tool, as well as many other free tools like Apache Directory Studio, LDAP Admin or my favorite, Softerra LDAP browser. Example using LDP: There are numerous tests you can perform: Basic port 389 –or- 3268 with no authentication using your NetID account to authenticate. Secure port 636 –or- 3269 using Service account credentials to Bind to the LDAP with. Once successfully connected, you can use the Browse and Filter for the specific information to test the results you are looking for. Group, service account or user. Open LDP (if it is already installed on your computer) From the Connection, select server: OR another test: For the port leave 389 as this is an initial test and select OK For production you can change this to port 636 and SSL as that is what will be used. You will then select from Connection, Bind, and enter in the Service Account name and password to test that functionality. Select from Connection, Bind, and “Bind as currently logged on user”. (This will display the “USER” connection string.) Select OK Next, Select from Browse, and enter in for example, my Object DN CN=maars001,OU=UserAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu (Substitute maars001 with your or any valid NetID. Note for a service account this will be: CN=DHTS_ServiceAccount,OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu Select Run to execute the search.

Please Note: that these attributes may not always be the case and is shown here for a general guide line in case your application requires some of these attributes during setup. Always follow the recommended setup for your LDAP in the Vendor supplied Configuration guide. Server SettingsSetting DescriptionName A descriptive name that will help you to identify the directory. Examples: • Internal directory with LDAP Authentication • Corporate LDAP for Authentication OnlyDirectory Type Select the type of LDAP directory that you will connect to.  If you are adding a new LDAP connection, the value you select here will determine  the default values for some of the options on the rest of screen. Examples: • Microsoft Active Directory (* This is recomended for non-Windows configurations) • Apache Directory Server (ApacheDS) • Apple Open Directory • Fedora Directory Server • Novell eDirectory • OpenDS • OpenLDAP • OpenLDAP Using Posix Schema • Posix Schema for LDAP • Sun Directory Server Enterprise Edition (DSEE) • A generic LDAP directory serverHostname The host name of your directory server. Examples: • dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu (* Preferred LDAP name to use) • dhe.duke.edu (Test purposes only)Port The port on which your directory server is listening. Examples: • 389 (Test only - allows clear text) • 636 (* Must use for SSL - allows encrypted data)Use SSL Check SSL box if the connection is using the directory server using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection.  Note that you may need to configure an SSL certificate in order to use this setting. NOTE: When using the LDAP "dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu", on a Windows machine, you do not need an SSL certificate. In some extreme cases the non-Windows machine may require a copy of the cert to be installed locally on that machine. Username The distinguished Service Account name of the user that the application will use when connecting to the directory server. Examples: • CN=<ServiceAccount>,OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu (Must) • CN=<NetID>,OU=UserAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu (Test only) • dhe\<NetID>  • <NetID>@duhe.duke.edu Password The password of the service account or user specified above. Schema SettingsSetting DescriptionBase DN The root distinguished name (DN) to use when running queries against the directory server. Examples: • DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu • For Microsoft Active Directory, specify the base DN in the following format: DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu. Microsoft provides a tool called ldp.exe which is useful for finding out, configuring, and testing the the LDAP structure of your server.User Name Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the username. Examples: • cn • sAMAccountName Advanced SettingsSetting DescriptionEnable Nested Groups Enable or disable support for nested groups.  Some directory servers allow you to define a group as a member of another group. Groups in such a structure are called 'nested groups'. If you are using groups to manage permissions, you can create nested groups to allow inheritance of permissions from one group to its sub-groups.Use Paged Results Enable or disable the use of the LDAP control extension for simple paging of search results.  If paging is enabled, the search will retrieve sets of data rather than all of the search results at once. Enter the desired page size – that is, the maximum number of search results to be returned per page when paged results are enabled. The default is 1000 results.Follow Referrals Choose whether to allow the directory server to redirect requests to other servers.  This option uses the node referral (java.naming.referral) configuration setting. It is generally needed for Active Directory servers configured without proper DNS, to prevent a 'javax.naming.PartialResultException: Unprocessed Continuation Reference(s)' error. User Schema SettingsNote: this section is for when User "Login is enabled" using AD credentials.Setting DescriptionAdditional User DN This value is used in addition to the base DN when searching and loading users.  If no value is supplied, the subtree search will start from the base DN. Example: • OU=UserAccounts,OU=EnterpriseAccounts,DC=dhe,DC=duke,DC=edu (* All enabled DHE <NetID> accounts) • ou=Users - (* This is not valid in DHE as there are NO uses in that OU)User Object Class This is the name of the class used for the LDAP user object. Example: • userUser Object Filter The filter to use when searching user objects. Example: • (&(objectCategory=Person)(sAMAccountName=*))User Name RDN Attribute The RDN (relative distinguished name) to use when loading the username.  The DN for each LDAP entry is composed of two parts: the RDN and the location within the LDAP directory where the record resides. The RDN is the portion of your DN that is not related to the directory tree structure. Example: • cnUser First Name Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the user's first name. Example: • givenNameUser Last Name Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the user's last name. Example: • snUser Display Name Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the user's full name. Example: • displayNameUser Email Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the user's email address. Example: • mail Group Schema SettingsNote: this section is for when both User on Login and Synchronize Group Memberships are enabled.Setting DescriptionAdditional Group DN This value is used in addition to the base DN when searching and loading groups.  If no value is supplied, the subtree search will start from the base DN. Example: • ou=GroupsGroup Object Class This is the name of the class used for the LDAP group object. Examples: • group • groupOfUniqueNames (* may not exist in Windows AD)Group Object Filter The filter to use when searching group objects. Example: • (objectCategory=Group)Group Name Attribute The attribute field to use when loading the group's name.

Example: • description --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SSL Certificate Example.NOTE: This is for informational purposes only. The certificate used for dhe-ldap.dhe.duke.edu is generated by InCommon (Comodo) and is located in the F5 VIP which makes using this LDAP more efficient, safe and easy to configure. If your application is hosted on a Linux server you can export the Root Certificate from your local Windows machine and import that into your Linux local Cert Store. This will be used in conjunction with the F5 LDAP Load Balancing SSL Cert already installed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Support: EIS-OIT Site Manager would like to receive an email alert when a user requests access to a SharePoint site.

If you need further assistance: Because of the special URLs Duke WordPress course sites creates (course_section_term – for example, environ300_10_f2011), it usually makes more sense to start a new course site each semester. However, some sites might contain content or conversations that a faculty member wants to share with a new set of students. The following options might help with re-using WP content: Option 1: Create a new course site and copy the material over Follow the instructions to create a course site for this semester-now. Leave that site alone for a moment. In your ‘old’ course site, go to the Dashboard view, click Tools and then ‘Export’. Choose ‘All Content’ and click Download Export File. This should drop an XML file on your computer (in a downloads folder, on your desktop, or wherever your browser is set to download files to). In your NEW site, go to the Dashboard, click Tools and click Import. Choose ‘WordPress‘. Choose your file that you just downloaded to your computer and click ‘Upload file and import’. Caveats: WordPress doesn’t really make an exact copy of everything from your previous site -it only brings over the text, images and links. You’ll have to do some housekeeping on your new site. For example, you’ll probably want to change the theme to the same one you previously used, and probably check your ‘widgets’ to make sure you have the same ones. Option 2: Add your new students to the current course (even though it has last year’s URL, etc) This would be the simpler option. Faculty can actually add other student enrollments to an existing course site using the Duke Toolkits tool. See the page on combining multiple enrollments to learn how. Caveats: you’ll have the same URL with the old term designation. Your students from the previous semester will also still have access to the site. If you don’t want your students from last semester to add anything to the site – just make them all ‘subscribers’ in the site prior to adding the new students. That way the posts your previous students wrote will still be properly attributed – and they’ll still be able to see them – but they won’t be able to write new posts on your site. If you are a graduating student, a faculty or a staff member leaving Duke (and therefore will no longer have an active Duke NetID), you have several options for your site, depending on your desired outcome. Course Sites 1. If you want to make access changes to a site related to an academic course… Per the Sites@Duke Retention Policy, academic sites remain on Duke’s server for 5 years. Unless you changed the Site Visibility settings to a Subsite that you created in a class (Dashboard > Settings > Reading Settings), the default setting is that the site is only viewable to the members of your class. Consult with the faculty member who taught your course if you have any questions or concerns about your site. Non-Course Sites 1. If you want to keep your site active and available after you leave… You can export your Sites@Duke WordPress site and move it to another WordPress instance by following these steps: On your Sites@Duke Dashboard, use the menu bar on the left side to navigate to Tools and then Export. If you want to export your entire site, select ‘All content’, which is the default option, and click the button to ‘Download Export File’. If a dialog box pops up, select 'Save File' and click 'Ok'. This should download a .xml file into the default folder your computer uses for files downloaded through your browser. Log into, or create, your WordPress account at https://wordpress.com/ and create or navigate to your site that you would like to transfer your Sites@Duke site to. Once you are logged into your non-Duke Wordpress site, navigate to the Dashboard by adding '/wp-admin' to the end of your non-Duke site's URL [For example: testsite.wordpress.com/wp-admin]. Once on the Dashboard of your WordPress instance site, navigate again to Tools, this time selecting Import. NOTE: If this option does not appear in the menu bar, copy and paste this link in your browser: https://*******.wordpress.com/wp-admin/import.php Replace the ****** with the name of your WordPress site (found in the URL as https://******.wordpress.com) On the Import page, find ‘WordPress’ in the list of options and click 'Run Importer' underneath it. Click 'Browse' and select the .xml file from Step 4 from your default downloads folder. Click 'Upload file and import'. Assign authors to your posts/content as necessary. WordPress will process your site and send you an email when it is finished and uploaded. Click ‘Choose File’ and select the .xml file from step c from your Downloads folder, then click ‘Upload file and import’. WordPress will process your site and send you an email when it is finished being processed and uploaded. 2. If you want your site to expire and disappear after you leave… If you don’t need or want to access your site after you leave Duke, you can leave it up and it will eventually expire along with your Duke NetID. Alternatively, you can delete your site with the following steps: On your Sites@Duke Dashboard, use the menu bar on the left side to navigate to Tools and then Delete Site. You must check the box that acknowledges that your site will be permanently deleted and can never be recovered – DO NOT delete your site if you are unsure whether you would like to access it again! If you are sure, click the button that says ‘Delete my site permanently’. Once you do this, you will receive an email to your Duke email address asking you to confirm that you’d like to delete your site – click the link in this email to permanently remove your site. If you do not click this link, your site will NOT be deleted. 3. If you want your site to continue at Duke without you, after you leave… You can add another member of the Duke community to your site as an Administrator. For example, if you are the President of a club, you can add the future president as the new Admin so he or she will be able to access and update the site when you leave Duke. NOTE: It is best practice to have a second administrator on your site. Student groups should consider adding their advisor. Follow the steps below to add a new user: On your Sites@Duke Dashboard, use the menu bar on the left side to navigate to Users and then Add New. Enter the Duke NetID (or Duke email address) of the person you would like to add to your site, and select ‘Administrator’ as the role. Click Next. The user will have been added to your site and requires no further action. 4. You don’t want anyone to see your site or find it through searching the web…. Go to Dashboard > Settings > Reading Settings to check your settings. Check “I would like my site to be visible only to Admins” so that only you (and any other Admins) can see the site and no one else.  Check “Discourage search engines from indexing this site” to prevent your site from being searched. Click Save Changes NOTE: You will be prompted to renew your site annually and once you lose your DukeNetID you would not be able to renew your site. Questions?

Duke cannot guarantee delivery of such messages.  In particular, forwarding reliability may be affected by policies set by either the sender's email domain or by the recipient's email domain.  This means that some messages may be received at Duke and forwarded to the destination but not displayed in the non-Duke destination mailbox.  The way this works may change over time as various email providers change their policies.  Duke has no control over this behavior. If you decide to set up forwarding to an external provider and need to be sure that you don't lose any email, be sure to choose to "keep a copy" of forwarded messages in your Duke mailbox.  Then, regularly review your Duke mailbox for any messages that were not delivered to your destination.

Qualtrics also provides several ways to email or link to a survey – but doesn’t directly show you how to display a survey on a WordPress site – though it’s possible with a few small tricks. (Please note that if this method proves too cumbersome and/or doesn’t work for you, you can always just add a link to your survey for people to access and take). 1. First, create your Qualtrics survey and make sure you’ve launched and activated it . Once activated, Qualtrics will provide you with an Anonymous Survey Link. Copy that link and hold on to it. 2. Go to the Dashboard for the Duke WordPress site you want to add your Qualtrics survey to (note: you must be an administrator of the site you want to add a survey to in order to do this next step!). Click Plugins from the dashboard, and choose Activate under Qualtrics Survey Embeds on the page. This plugin will allow you to add the code necessary to display your Qualtrics survey.3. Create a new Page or Post in your Duke WordPress site and give the page a title. To embed the survey, simply paste the Anonymous Survey Link to your survey on its own line in the editor (making sure you’re on the Visual tab, not Text). 4. Click Update or Publish to create the page or post. You should now see your embedded Qualtrics survey on your WordPress page or post. To change the default embed settings (e.g. survey dimensions). Go to the Dashboard and under Setting select Qualtrics Settings. In a typical Sites@Duke site, faculty who create the site become the ‘administrators’ and students get added to the site as ‘authors’.  Roles can be modified for different users, and roles have to be selected for each new user added by an administrator. Here’s a quick summary of the different roles available in WordPress. Read a more detailed explanation from WordPress.org. Role Capability Use Administrator
prompt: Can edit site appearance, manage users and privacy settings, and write posts and pages, completion:  Faculty who create sites automatically become administrators of those sites. Students who create subsites will automatically become administrators of that site. Editors
prompt: Can create, edit and publish pages and posts, completion:  Students who need to be able to edit WordPress Pages (in addition to Posts) can be made Editors of sites by changing their roles using Toolkits. Authors
prompt: Can create and publish posts, but not access or edit pages, completion:  Students are automatically added to sites as Authors – allowing them to write and publish posts as well as comment on other posts. They also have access to pages created by the instructor – but cannot edit those pages. Contributors
prompt: Can create and edit posts, but not publish them, completion:  For those contributing to the site that might need proofreading or approval. Requires an admin or editor to publish. Subscribers
prompt: Can access a private blog and write comments, completion:  If the site is private, non-Duke guests will need to be subscribers to see any of the content. Also a useful role for commentors and other site guests. Student organizations can use Sites@Duke to create their organizations web site.  When you create your site, the URL will be sites.duke.edu/yourorganizationsname Because Sites@Duke uses Duke NetID, you can easily add other Duke people. If you have a website on dukegroups, you can quickly get started by exporting it from there and importing it to Sites@Duke. To do so, go to the dashboard > Tools > Export/Import. Administration and Transition Use sub-sites to manage and share special content while keeping it linked to your main website. For example, you can: create a sub-site for your fall signature event and make sure that whoever is in charge of that event has admin access. Or have a private sub-site for executive members only to facilitate collaboration and share administrative updates. Make sure to add your club advisor as an admin, so that they can always help the new executive members gain access to your site. Working with Media Only upload your most important files to the site (e.g., logo, constitution, special graphics). If you need to store and archive a lot of files, consider using Box (box.duke.edu). For pictures, you can use Flickr and add the pictures to your site using the SlickrFlickr or FlickrPhotostream plugins. For videos, you can setup a YouTube account for your organization. Social Network The Share Buttons by AddToAny plugin makes it easy to enable visitors to share content from your site. Events Management You can use the My Calendar plugin to manage and share your events. You can also add your events to calendar.duke.edu, and then build an RSS feed that you will publish on your website. Alternatively, you can try to embed a Google calendar into a page. Appearance and Design You can consult DiDA for advice and help on designing your site. Remember that Sites@Duke is updated throughout the year and you can submit requests for plugins that you would like to see included in the future. Changing a site’s title and tagline A site administrator can change the title and tagline of a site. Click Settings, then General to reveal the General Settings options. Change the blog title and/or tagline in the appropriate boxes and click update. Click on ‘Visit Site’ to see the change take effect: NOTE: Changing the title of your blog/site will not change the actual web address (the URL). This is set by the system based on your course information. Changing a site’s appearance Themes The appearance of WordPress sites can be changed quickly using by switching themes. Themes make up the graphic design and general layout for your WordPress site. To change your site’s theme, click Appearance > Themes, and choose to either Preview or Activate a new theme. NOTE: Changing themes can also change the style of your text and the overall layout of your site. It’s always a good idea to write down any custom features (custom CSS, widgets, plugin info) that you’ve added to your site before changing themes. For more info: UMW Blogs support site – Appearance section UCalgary: What Theme Should I Use? UCalgary: Changing Your Design (video): UCalgary (vide0): Changing Your Design WordPress.com: Change the Look of your Blog Widgets and Sidebars You may want to include a items in your sidebar which, depending on your theme, generally appears to the right or left of your main content. By adding different “widgets,” you can add links, search boxes, navigational elements and more to your site. Many new WordPress themes offer a way to customize their menus. Here’s how it works: 1. Login to your site and visit the Dashboard view. 2. Click the Appearance menu and select Menus. 3. Check to see if your theme allows Custom Menus. Look in the Theme Locations box (see image below): If the text states that your theme supports at least 1 menu, then you can use the Custom Menus options to customize your overall menus on your site. If it doesn’t, you can still use this tool – but the custom navigation will have to be placed in your sidebar as a Widget instead. 4. Click the ‘+’ button to create a new set of menus. Give the menu set a name. 5. If you’ve already created Pages and/or Posts on your site, you can use them to build up your custom menu. For example, if I want to add several of my site’s pages to the menu, I can place a check next to them in the Pages box, then click Add to Menu. The pages will show up under the new menu. Click ‘Save Menu’ then enable it under the Theme Locations box by choosing it from the drop-down menu as your ‘Primary Navigation’ and clicking Save. You can rearrange menu items by dragging and dropping them as needs be (meaning, in most cases, the top most item will appear on the left of your navigation on your page). You can also drag items under other items to create subpages. To illustrate, here’s the WordPress site using the navigation in the images above: This page is for adding Duke users (those with netIDs). For information on how to add non-Duke users, click HERE. Users with Administrative privileges (e.g. those who created the sites, faculty teaching a course, etc.) can add other users (both Duke and non-Duke) to a site. When adding users to your site, you will need to determine which user role – access level you would like that user to have.  Read more about user roles. NOTE: If a non-Duke user is not interacting with the site (e.g. adding pages or posts) you can change your privacy settings to allow non-Duke users to see and comment on your site. Adding users Choose ‘Add New” under the Users Section of the dashboard to add users by Duke NetID address. Enter the user’s Duke NetID, choose the user’s  role for your site, and click “add”. NOTE: If you are a faculty member who has created a site using Duke’s Toolkits, enrolled students in your course will automatically be added into your site.

There are hundreds of third-party applications that have been written for Box. Box's security provisions are robust enough to safeguard educational, financial and sensitive data. However, these safeguards exist between the Box.com servers and your computer (or that of a collaborator).

For these reasons, all apps to be used within Duke's Box environment must be reviewed and must meet security, licensing and legal requirements. In order to be approved, apps must meet the following criteria: Support single sign-on Data must be encrypted in transport (SSL or TLS) Never take content outside of secure Box storage (pass through to display is OK, but copying / caching files on local devices is not allowed) Provide a service not adequately covered by other approved Box applications Apps will be run in the approved / appropriate environment Apps that require licensing fees and/or payment to Box or a third-party vendor will be considered if: Payment for app will be made by requesting party Payment for app does not require central payment or coordination A suitable business case can be made for central payment To request that a Box application be reviewed and approved, please complete the request form.

NAS – OIT has a NAS (CIFS or NFS) offering which by allowing connectivity via the network is often used for departments/schools as it can be accessed directly from outside of the datacenter.  NAS utilizes the IP network instead of the SAN to allow access to the storage. Additionally NAS allows the storage to be shared by multiple clients. Departmental Share uses the same technology. The Protected Network is a resource for storage and analysis of Sensitive research data. The network is separated virtually from the general Duke network and has more extensive security protections. It comprises dedicated storage and virtual machines (VMs), and requires specific authorization from the Campus ITSO for access.

prompt: What is my username and password?, completion:  There are a few passwords that you will need to know to install, register, and use Spok Mobile: To download Spok Mobile from App Store or Google Play, you will need to set up an account with Apple (iOS) or Google (Android). This is your responsibility and is outside of the control of IT. You will use this to download the application from the AppStore (iOS) or Google Play (Android). To register Spok Mobile upon first accessing the application on your mobile device, you must use the Spok Mobile registration username and password. This will be sent to you *in an email* To send messages via Spok Mobile the first time from your mobile device, you will need to Authenticate using your Spok messaging id/username and Password. Messaging ID/ User name is the 7 digit pager number Messaging ID / User name is the 4 digit pager number for Duke Regional Rarely used but initially a few users were setup using their Unique ID All users password is their 10 digit cell phone number Should I “allow push notifications” when downloading the application? Yes. If you do not “allow push notifications” when downloading the application if/when prompted, you will not be actively notified when messages are received. If you accidentally choose to not allow push notifications when downloading the application, you will need to manually turn on notifications in the Apple Notification Center. To do this, go to the iOS settings, then choose Notifications, then choose the Spok Mobile applications, then make sure all options are turned ON.
prompt: How do I update Spok Mobile?, completion:  Updates will be pushed to you automatically through the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). When you are notified of updates, just go to the App Store or Google Play to download them from there. Note: If you see the registration page upon first opening the application after the first update, just tap register. Your registration information should already be auto populated.
prompt: What mobile devices are compatible with Spok Mobile?, completion:  Spok Mobile works on iOS and Android platforms. The application also works on older Blackberry platforms; however, Blackberry 10 is not supported. Other mobile operating systems, such as Windows Phone, are not supported. Android phones 4.4. or less is not supported. I have a new mobile device what should I do? Submit a request to cancel the registration on the old device and request to have the new device registered with Spok Mobile. Network
prompt: Do devices need to be connected to Wi-Fi, cell network or both to receive messages?, completion:  Devices running the Spok Mobile application need to be on Wi-Fi or a cell network in order to receive messages.
prompt: Does Spok Mobile work on “guest” Wi-Fi networks?, completion:  Avoid "guest" Wi-Fi networks, as they may cause missed or delayed.   If you log in to Wi-Fi networks that have captive portals (i.e. Wi-Fi networks that require you to accept terms and conditions – such as airport, etc. hotel guest networks), make sure to “Forget This Network” in the devices Wi-Fi settings when disconnecting from the Wi-Fi network. If you do not do this, the next time you come in range of the network, your messages will not be received until you sign in again.
prompt: Why can’t I receive Spok Mobile messages while on an active phone call on a Verizon Wireless or Sprint phone?, completion:  Some Verizon Wireless or Sprint mobile phones that is connected to a 3G network do not support data and voice at the same time. Since Spok Mobile uses data, when you are on an active call (which uses voice), the message cannot be delivered until the voice connection is disconnected. The message will continue to retry and will be delivered as soon as the call is disconnected. For Verizon users who have an iphone it is possible to receive messages while on an active call. Using your iphone settings, go to Settings --> Cellular --> Cellular Data Options and check to see that the Enable LTE Voice&Data is ON or SET. If this setting is set to LTE Data only, messages will not come in during an active call. Note: This FAQ does not apply to most other carriers, such as AT&T Wireless, T-Mobile, etc, who use GSM for 3G. This only applies to 3G CDMA networks and some 4G LTE phones on the Verizon network. Sometimes when I receive multiple messages in a row, they are not in chronological order. Why is that happening? Occasionally, if you receive multiple messages in a row in rapid succession, you may see messages delivered out of chronological order. If your device is off or not connected to a network / out of coverage range, messages will continue to retry until delivered to your device. The retry intervals initially occur each second and then become less aggressive over time. Based upon the retry interval cycles, messages will be delivered to the device as soon as it is powered on and connected to a network / in coverage range. Since the device might be back online after the first message has retried, but before the second has retried at certain points in time, messages may be delivered out of order.
prompt: Why are my messages delayed?, completion:  Spok Mobile requires connectivity to a data network (mobile carrier or Wi-Fi) in order for messages to be delivered. If you are seeing a delay in receiving messages, or a delay in the message being presented to you when launching the application, check your network connection on your mobile device to make sure you are connected to the mobile network or Wi-Fi. If you are not connected, or there are network connectivity issues, messages may be delayed. A rule of thumb is that you should be able to receive messages via Spok Mobile on a device if you can receive an email on the device and visit websites on the device. Messages will continue to retry until successfully delivered; therefore, messages may be delayed, but will likely not be missed or lost.
prompt: What is the coverage range of Spok Mobile?, completion:  You can receive Spok Mobile messages wherever you are connected to an available network to receive data to your device. This includes the range of the nationwide/global network of your Mobile Carrier (i.e. Verizon, AT&T, etc), and anywhere you have access to a Wi-Fi network, globally. Notifications and Nuances
prompt: How do I turn the application off when I’m not at work?, completion:  Open the app on your device and open the drawer (upper left). Then change your status to “Not On Page”
prompt: Can I personalize my notifications and sounds?, completion:  Yes, there is a Settings menu within the application with several options to customize you app within the parameters set by your manager. Pop-up notifications are set by your own device's settings. Every time I get a page on my iPhone, I receive multiple notifications for each message. Why is that happening? On iPhone, Spok Mobile pushes separate notifications to the iOS device until the message acknowledged. Each of these notifications may appear to be different notifications when you receive them, but you will see that this is only one message when you launch the application.
prompt: When users send messages to you from the web and other messaging applications, they can select from these priorities. Messages sent to you will default to medium, but will follow any priority defined by the sender., completion:  Group messages like Code Blue will be priorities of medium or high by default, depending upon the nature of the group message.
prompt: Why can’t I read Spok Mobile messages without having to unlock my phone?, completion:  Spok Mobile was designed with security in mind. For this reason, message content is presented behind locked screens to prevent unintended parties from reading messages.
prompt: When receiving an Spok Mobile notification, you will see the alert in the locked screen, but must unlock the device to read the message content. When active notifications have not yet been read, the application should open automatically upon unlocking the device., completion:  Device Settings If I put my iPhone on Do Not Disturb (DND), will my messages still make a sound? No. Your messages will not make a sound if your iOS device is set to Do Not Disturb (DND). There is currently no way to provision an exception for this. If you need your messages to actively alert you please avoid using the DND feature.
prompt: How do I silence my Spok Mobile messages, or change it to make a tone when it is silent?, completion:  To configure whether or not Spok Mobile alerts you silently or out loud, go to the settings, Notifications, and select Spok Mobile. Scroll down and set the Sounds option to ON for Spok Mobile to make a sound, or to OFF if you want it to be silent. By default, this setting is set to ON and it is recommended to always leave Sounds ON.
prompt: When I receive a Spok Mobile message and reminder tones are received until I acknowledge the message, it looks like I am receiving multiple messages when I have only received one. Why is this happening?, completion:  Spok Mobile pushes separate notifications to the iOS device until the message acknowledged. Each of these notifications may appear to be different messages when you receive them, but you will see that this is only one message when you launch the application.
prompt: How do I change how the Spok Mobile screen pop alerts me?, completion:  To change how Spok Mobile alerts you, go to the device settings, Notifications, and select Spok Mobile. Here you can choose whether you want Spok Mobile to alert you with a Banner at the top of your iOS screen or an Alert in the middle of your iOS screen. Messaging
prompt: Can I message more than one person at a time?, completion:  Yes. However, their replies will only be sent to you and not everyone in the group message
prompt: How do I know if my message was received?, completion:  From the SM application, upon opening the message, messages include a color coded symbol to indicate the status of your messages: Blue—message has been sent but not accepted or viewed Green—message has been accepted and read Gray—message has timed out, not been read, accepted or viewed.
prompt: Can a person send a secure message to another person without using a smart phone? For example, can a person compose and send a message on a desktop computer that will be received as a secure text message by the other party?, completion:  Yes. A registered user can log in to the web-based application and send a message to the other person. The message is received as a secure text message. Are secure text messages sent via Spok Mobile discoverable? Yes. The hospital has a log of all message sent and received and will be able to discover messages for compliance purposes.
prompt: Can a person outside the hospital network send a secure message to someone else in the hospital network? And vice versa? For example, can a telephone operator at a community hospital send a message a physician in the network, or can a physician in the network send a message to a physician outside of the network?, completion:  No. Only users that are part of the hospital network can communicate via this system. Usage Is there a cost per message? No. There is no cost per message. Spok Mobile uses data. Mobile data charges will apply for any message delivered over mobile data networks. Though most messages will not consume much data, depending on the size of attachments some may be larger. Note that Spok Mobile does not use SMS and therefore will not incur any text messaging charges.
prompt: Does Spok Mobile use a lot of memory and space on my device?, completion:  No. The application itself is very small (22.3 MB vs Facebook which takes 598 MB) and none of the messages are saved onto your device.
prompt: Does Spok Mobile use a lot of battery on my device?, completion:  No. Spok Mobile should use less than 1% of your battery life when used regularly. The app requires little background activity and does not require much battery while running.

prompt: How to Request SPOK Mobile Service, completion:  1.  Go to https://dhts.duke.edu
prompt: How to Request Deactivation of SPOK Mobile Service, completion:  1.  Go to https://dhts.duke.edu Consider the following questions prior to requesting Data Commons storage, as we will need these answers to provision a share: (1)  Do you want the storage to be available for mounting on local workstations or does it need to be mounted on the Duke Compute Cluster (DCC)? (1a)  Do you want to mount the storage as CIFS ("SMB") or NFS? (The former is usually used for local Windows or Mac workstations; the latter for DCC or for linux workstations) (1b)  If you are requesting "NFS" AND the share is to be mounted somewhere OTHER THAN (or in addition to) the DCC, what are the IP addresses of the systems that need to mount the NFS share? (2)  The cost associated is $80 per TB per year.  This cost is based on the ALLOCATION, not on the amount ACTUALLY USED.  If data will flow in over time, it may be more cost effective to request a base amount now, and to increase that amount closer to the point of need for the additional storage.  Given that, what initial allocation would you like? (3)  What fund code would you like to charge for the costs noted in (2)? (4)  Do you want this storage to be backed up? (Note that THIS cost is for the amount ACTUALLY USED rather than for the ALLOCATION!) (5)  Can you confirm that no "sensitive" data will be stored in this space? (6)  Which netIDs will need access (permissions) to this storage? (7)  Do you have a "lab name" that should be used in naming the share, for easier tracking? (8)  Do you foresee an immediate need to use Globus to transfer data to/from this new storage? Questions about any of the above?  Send a message to rescomputing@duke.edu and we'll be happy to help!
prompt: What is Proofpoint Quarantine:, completion:  Proofpoint Quarantine gives you the ability to view the messages that our email gateways (Proofpoint) have identified as SPAM. Using this tool, you can easily check to see if any legitimate messages have been caught and if so, take action to release the messages, report false positives and create a PERSONAL white-list for senders. It is important to note that this tool does not directly interact with your email client(s) in any way, so you will have to use this tool to observe the contents of Proofpoint's quarantine folder. It is also important to note that at this time, this does NOT guarantee a Proofpoint personal white-listed sender's mail won't be marked as "Junk Mail" by Microsoft.
prompt: How do you access it?, completion:  Log in to the Quarantine portal. You will be presented with a list of quarantined items(if any) and an menu bar with options. Clicking on an entry will present details on the bottom of the page that will provide part of the message.
prompt: What are your options and what do they do?, completion:  Find Report Phish Not Spam Release Delete Allow Sender Options Search for a specific words that might be blocked Report a 'phishing' attempt to the vendor for analysis
prompt: Does not send the message to your mailbox, but does report it as not spam to Proofpoint.  You would then need to select the message and click the “Release” button to have the message delivered., completion:  Releases the message with no further action Delete the message and take no further action Add sender to your 'safelist' ONLY in Proofpoint Refresh the page. May change with more options in the future FAQ's
prompt: What messages are visible in quarantine?, completion:  Items marked as malware, phishing, virus are not displayed.  We are only presenting items that were caught strictly by the spam filter of our mail system. The spam rule triggers at a spam score of greater than or equal to 50.  So, anything < 50 is delivered and anything >= 50 is quarantined by the Proofpoint servers.  This is a vendor recommending setting for the handling of spam. Another category of messages that are displayed in quarantine are those which have failed Sender Policy Framework (SPF) validation.  For more information on SPF please see KB0027748.
prompt: How far back can I view my quarantine?, completion:  30 days
prompt: Can I adjust my spam scoring?, completion:  This is not currently available as the spam setting is a system wide configuration item.
prompt: What if I find a legitimate message in quarantine?, completion:  If there are messages that are not spam that are showing in your quarantine, you can report them to Proofpoint by selecting the message and then clicking the “Not Spam” button at the top of the page.  This does not send the message to your mailbox, but just reports it as not spam.  You would then need to select the message and click the “Release” button to have the message delivered.  If you would like the sender white-listed for you moving forward, then you would click “Release".
prompt: Why can I only see part of a message?, completion:  We limit the amount of content displayed in the message and only show you the first portion.  The intent of quarantine is not to be a mail client but to give you enough information to determine if the message is spam.  Likewise, links are disabled, images are not loaded, and attachments are not visible in the quarantine view. Safe/Block Lists? We allow safe listing in Proofpoint via the quarantine UI.  This means that messages from safe senders should transit though Proofpoint without being marked as Spam.  Messages from senders in your Outlook/Exchange Online blocked senders list are found in your Junk folder within your regular mailbox.  Also, note that messages from safe senders in Proofpoint could still land in Junk in Exchange Online (O365), so you may want to also add these senders as safe senders in your Exchange Online mailbox either via OWA or Outlook.

For any questions, contact Maestro Care- Provider Record Design in Service Now.
prompt: Who Needs an SER/Provider Record?, completion:  SER records are created based on Epic recommendation standard rules that are expanded per organization based on credentialing requirements, billing requirements, and more. These four characteristics determine if someone or something needs a provider record: •Credentials •Authorize orders/Ordering Provider •Referrals (can be referred to or referred by) •Can be scheduled with
prompt: What is Typically Not Found in the Provider and Resource (SER) Master File?, completion:  The ability to log in to Epic and perform functions within the system is governed by a separate set of master files, the cornerstone of which is the User (EMP) master file. Therefore, many employees at your organization don't need an SER record because they don't meet any of the above criteria. For example, the following employee types don't need SER records to perform their job functions: •Schedulers (at Duke Schedulers do get SERs because we have a required order mode of 'entered by' for the declined cosign workflow) •Admissions staff •Billing staff, facilities •Security personnel Most customers don't create SER records for adjunct caregivers such as emergency transporters, who don't document clinical information and therefore don't need their medical credentials stamped into the patient's medical record. Two resources that aren't found in the master file are hospital rooms and beds. When patients are admitted in Epic's Grand Central system, the patient is assigned to a room and bed that have records in the Room (ROM) and Bed (BED) master files, respectively. The separate master files for these resources allow for the flexibility Grand Central needs. Examples of Common Records in the Provider and Resource (SER) Master File Caregivers include: Primary care physicians Specialty physicians Surgeons Cardiologists Therapists Nurses Social workers Case workers Dietitians Nurse practitioners Technicians Unit secretaries Pharmacists Referring physicians

The HScribe system is a 24 X 7 Holter processing and storage system which is used at Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital, Southpoint Cardiology and Triangle Heart Associates. The HScribe application receives patients' test data from end device portable Holter recorders. Holter data is manually exported or 'pulled' from the recorders via a special USB cable and the data is uploaded into the HScribe system for processing. The HScribe system is interfaced with Maestro Care for linking with orders and results which allow Holter results to appear in the patient chart. The system is supported by the DHTS Application Support Cardiology Department. To speak with a Duke Health Service Desk representative, call (919) 684-2243. There is NO upfront cost to the department when ordering a new phone number and digital VoIP telephone. Departments are simply charged the current monthly allocated digital line rate for each phone ordered.  OIT currently offers a single digital telephone model, Cisco 8841. This is a five button digital telephone with full speaker capabilities. OIT does NOT support single line analog devices. The department is responsible for the purchase and maintenance of all analog telephones. OIT assigns and provisions the analog line/number only. Exceptions: There are three exceptions to the guidelines above for digital VoIP phones. Conference Phones - Departments are fiscally responsible for the purchase of all Conference phones through OIT and are charged the monthly allocated digital line rate. Current model is the Cisco 8832 $ 660.00 Wi-Fi Phones - Departments are fiscally responsible for the purchase of all Wi-Fi phones and are charged the monthly allocated digital line rate. Current model is the Cisco 8821. Health System users purchase these devices through DHTS. Analog Upgrade to Digital - Departments are fiscally responsible for the purchase of all digital VoIP telephones when converting an existing analog phone/line to digital through OIT and are charged the monthly allocated digital line rate. Current model is the Cisco 8841 $ 220.00 SmartNet Tracking and Renewal Coordination – All endpoint owners will be responsible for SmartNet contracts and the renewal. * An active Cisco SmartNet contract is required for all services described above. This will ensure that the endpoint is covered, if there's any kind of issues. Configuration Management Coordinate with the AV installation team to customize the configuration of the system to best fit the needs of the customer's anticipated use cases. Custom configuration will help to provide the best user experience based on current networking and video infrastructure environment. Service-now tickets Adding a video endpoint requires two tickets with service-now one ticket with the Network Engineering team The network team should have the endpoint in the VoIP/Voice vlan and on a private network Voice Engineering team.  The ticket to the VoIP team should have: The IP address of the endpoint The mac address of the endpoint Where the endpoint is located

You would need the serial number, mac address, and purchase date of the video endpoint, she fill you in on what's fully needed Most of the features of Duke Health's Mobile Device Manager come automatically, and are transparent to the way you use your device. Wifi and email are just as they've always been, with a few exceptions for certain device types. This article highlights some of the new options and capabilities and next steps for users with newly enrolled devices. Mail and Calendar: You have a few options for mail: Native / built-in mail app - If your device is made by Apple, Samsung, or Sony, or if it's a newer era HTC or LG device, your built-in mail app was configuring during enrollment. If you wish to have mail and calendar configured this way, there's nothing else to do. For other Android devices, including Google Pixels and Moto devices, we can't support native mail on those device, so read on for other options. VMware Boxer  - From the DH App Store. Boxer is a free, full featured standalone mail and calendar app from AirWatch/VMware and has some great features not available in other mail apps, as well as Android widgets for calendar and mail. Just download it from the DH App Store, login with your NetID password, and you're good to go - it's pre-configured for our environment and Office365 servers. You can test drive Boxer while native mail is configured - you'll just get two notifications for each mail arrival and calendar event. This is the recommended options for Google, Moto, Blu, and other Android devices not mentioned in the first option. Microsoft's Outlook app and the Nine app - Outlook is free from your vendor's app store, and Nine is a pay-for mail app (you're responsible for your own purchase of this), but if you want to use either, you'll need to contact the DHTS Service Desk to have it approved for your enrolled device so that it'll function. Touchdown - Touchdown has been declared end-of-life by its manufacturer, and Duke doesn't provide a Touchdown license, but if you already have a personal Touchdown license, you can install the profile to automatically configure it for Duke's O365 Exchange servers. Please don't manually configure native mail on your mobile device, regardless of manufacturer or operating system. Due to the way AirWatch and Office365 cooperate to manage mail, manual configurations won't work. Finally, if you don't wish to use native mail and calendar as automatically configured on your device - you'd rather use Boxer, for example: Android - launch Agent >> Profiles >> DH BYOD Android Exchange ActiveSync, tap the red X, and okay the removal. Apple / iOS - contact the DHTS Service Desk (links and numbers below) and ask them to "remove your DH BYOD iOS Exchange ActiveSync" profile from your device. Duke Health App Store: The DH App Store contains a collection of Duke-sanctioned and recommended apps, from Boxer (mentioned above) to Microsoft Office to Spok Mobile to Epic apps (same account creation prerequisites apply as before). Depending on your device, apps you select are installed with one tap, or may take a second tap to your vendor's app store to confirm installation. As of this writing, all the apps are free for Duke staff and faculty to install and use. Check back - we're always adding new apps! Privacy Check: This app will allow you to see the privacy settings that apply to your device any any given time: what Duke is tracking on your device and what we're not. It's a live query into the settings as they apply to your device the the time you open it. If you have any privacy questions or concerns, please contact the DHTS Service Desk (contact information below). VMware Tunnel: This app allows traffic for selected apps and Duke-internal websites to travel through a secure, transparent VPN tunnel. It's required for clinical applications and strongly recommended for all users. Not installing this may result in certain apps and sites not functioning. It can safely co-exist with Cisco's AnyConnect VPN client if you have that installed. To submit a request, go to the IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu), and click GET IT.

Workflows are more efficient, supports medication adherence, and increases convenience for patients.
prompt: When a physician gives a patient a handwritten prescription, there is no effective way to track whether the prescription is filled. Patients often forget to fill prescriptions, can’t afford the drug, lose the piece of paper, or start to feel better and decide not to take the medication., completion:  E-Prescribing allows physicians to verify whether patients fill prescriptions. Physicians also gain insight into the frequency with which patients are filling prescriptions for controlled substances, making it easier to spot potential drug abuse. Tracking how many controlled substance prescriptions a patient has received, reduces the likelihood of over-prescribing or doctor shopping. Currently, a pilot is underway with a controlled group in the Orthopedic Department. Future implementation is under review with Maestro Care Advisory boards. The following is required for a user to be EPCS activated in Maestro Care: All prescribers need to be "Identity Proofed". This process is organized with Credentialing Services office. Prescribers primary clinic is active for EPCS Prescriber activation is completed in Maestro Care For additional information, please contact the Duke Health service Desk at (919) 684-2243 and request a ticket be assigned to the Maestro Care Ambulatory-DHTS group OBJECTIVE This document explains how to enroll your device in Duke Health's Mobile Device Manager.

Android: Note: These instructions have been extensively tested, but due to the differences in different vendors’ Android implementation and differences between Android versions, your setup may vary slightly from the steps as published. These instructions assume you know basic settings on your device, or have someone available who does, in case you have questions. Some steps may be automatically skipped if your device is already compliant - e.g. lock PIN or device encryption. Steps 16, 17, and 18 are the most likely. Also note: And this can’t be stressed enough, make sure you have pictures and other irreplaceable data on your device backed up elsewhere. Enabling full device encryption shouldn’t cause any data loss, but no technology is infallible, and Duke in not reponsible for personal data loss.

prompt: What is DASC? (Davis Ambulatory Surgery Center), completion:  This application is the Ambulatory Surgery clinical information system which manages financial accounts related to payor or patient requests or payor audits. Mac Firewall Considerations: No special firewall changes should be required to accommodate IPv6. This is also true of Macs running Little Snitch. Little Snitch treats both types of addressing equally.To switch IPv6 to link-local only mode on a Mac, go to: System Preferences -> Networking -> Select the interface (WiFi, Ethernet, Thunderbolt, etc.) -> TCP/IP tab -> Set the "Configure IPv6" drop-down menu to "Link-local only". To disable IPv6 completely on a Mac: Run the following command in Terminal.app, where "WiFi" is the interface you want to disable IPv6 on: networksetup -setv6off Wi-FiThe following command will show the names of all available Hardware Ports on the computer: networksetup -listallhardwareports Windows Firewall Considerations: IPv6 support is enabled by default for Windows firewall. There are a number of inbound rules enabled for “Any” protocol, all tied to specific Microsoft programs. There is also a single “Core Networking” rule enabled for the “IPv6” protocol. To disable IPv6 or its components in Windows https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929852/how-to-disable-ipv6-or-its-components-in-windows (You must set a registry key.) Linux Firewall Considerations: Checking to see if enabled: Run the command: $ ip -6 addr show This will return something like the below output, if IPv6 is enabled.  By default, you will get an IPv6 address associated with your NIC 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000 inet6 fe80::250:56ff:fea1:b942/64 scope link Configuring IPv6 Firewall Rules Depending on your deployment, the IPv6 firewall may or may not be enabled. To see your IPv6 firewall, use the command: $ ip6tables -L -n –v You may want to be sure you have a default deny policy in place for IPv6 in your INPUT chain.  While you do want the default policy to deny, many localhost only applications depend on the loopback address allowing IPv6 traffic, so be sure to allow all IPv6 on the ‘lo’ interface.   Example chain: Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination 0     0 ACCEPT     all      lo     *       ::/0                 ::/0                 /* 001 accept all IPv6 to lo interface */ 0     0 ACCEPT     all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 /* 002 accept IPv6 related established rules */ ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED 0     0 ACCEPT     all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 state RELATED,ESTABLISHED 1    72 ACCEPT     icmpv6    *      *       ::/0                 ::/0 0     0 ACCEPT     all      lo     *       ::/0                 ::/0 0     0 ACCEPT     tcp      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 state NEW tcp dpt:22 0     0 ACCEPT     udp      *      *       ::/0                 fe80::/64            udp dpt:546 state NEW 0     0 REJECT     all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 reject-with icmp6-adm-prohibited 0     0 DROP       all      *      *       ::/0                 ::/0                 /* 999 drop all IPv6 INPUT */ Disabling IPv6 on Linux: If you do want to disable IPv6 from loading the following guides should help RHEL: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/8709 Ubuntu: http://www.binarytides.com/disable-ipv6-ubuntu/ Warpwire maintains documentation that covers how to record media directly into the Warpwire application here: https://www.warpwire.com/support/capture/capture-from-a-webcam-or-camera/ Please note that if you are using this feature, your files will not be downloadable or editable.

The desired group must have a name that is descriptive and will make sense to the wider community.  Additionally, the name must be an appropriate description for all members of the group -- a group may lose its "support" designation and all associated privileges if it is used to grant access to someone outside of the functional area. The group must be owned only by Duke staff or faculty who directly supervise the support team's function. Establishing your own Support Group: Create or identify a Group Manager group that meets the naming and functional descriptions above.  See this KB article for more about creating a Group Manager group. Submit a ServiceNow ticket to Identity Management - OIT asking for promotion of your group to a support group.  Please include the name of the group you wish to promote. OIT Identity Management will vet the request and, if approved, promote the group.  You will then see a "support" designation next to your group in Group Manager. Electronic Communication Policy Policy Statement: All Duke Health Enterprise electronic communication systems and data, however transmitted, are the property of the Duke Health Enterprise. This policy provides the requirements for secure communications through electronic media. Only authorized users may access the Duke Health Enterprise email system. All users of the Duke Health Enterprise email system are responsible for the security of data, using all available Duke Health-provided and supported administrative, technical, and physical security measures. Privacy should not be presumed with respect to email and similar data. As proprietary material owned by the Duke Health Enterprise, it may be accessed and monitored by Duke Health Enterprise as deemed necessary. Email that contains information regarding a patient's care or payment for care should not be forwarded or distributed without approval from the originator. Such communications should include the following warning: The information in this electronic mail is sensitive, protected information intended only for the addressee(s). Any other person, including anyone who believes he/she might have received it due to an addressing error, is requested to notify the sender immediately by return electronic mail, and to delete it without further reading or retention. The information is not to be forwarded to or shared unless in compliance with Duke Health policies on confidentiality and/or with the approval of the sender. Solicitations, chain letters, political or religious debate, threats, harassment, obscene material, sexual or ethnic jokes and slurs, defamatory statements, and idle gossip constitute a misuse of the system. Use of Duke Health Enterprise email for such communications is subject to disciplinary action. Email may not be automatically forwarded outside of the Duke Health Enterprise email system. Email containing Sensitive Electronic Information (SEI) and specifically PHI must be sent by encryption (for example, by using the "Sensitive Electronic Information" button in Outlook, or including the text "(secure)" as part of the Subject line). See attachment to this Policy for instructions on the encryption of electronic mail. E-mail Communication Between Provider and Patient (or Guardian Who Represents a Patient) Email communication between providers and patient may occur when a provider-patient relationship exists in which the healthcare provider has assumed an explicit measure of responsibility for the patient's care. Email communication will only be used if there is mutual agreement between the patient and provider. The provider may elect to communicate via e-mail if the patient makes this request (i.e., the patient requests communication via e-mail or the patient initiates an e-mail message to the provider). The use of a confidentiality statement at the beginning of each e-mail is required. Providers should not initiate any e-mail communication that contains PHI or other sensitive information. By statute, initial notification of HIV results must be a direct communication between the provider and the patient and, therefore, communication of HIV status by e-mail is forbidden. If it is necessary to send PHI to a patient, it must be encrypted unless the patient explicitly authorizes the message to be sent without encryption. Please note: PHI CANNOT be included in the email subject line because the subject line is not encrypted. Facsimile Health information shall be transmitted via facsimile only when the original record or mail-delivered copies will not meet the time constraint needs of immediate patient care. Only that information necessary to meet the specific needs of the requestor shall be transmitted. A cover page will accompany all operator-assisted or manual facsimile transmissions, including a confidentiality notice that indicates the information is confidential and limits it use. The following sample statement is provided as a guide: The information contained in this telecopy transmission contains legally privileged confidential information belonging to the sender. This information is intended only for the use of the individual or entity named above. The authorized recipient of this information is prohibited from disseminating, distributing, or copying this information. If you have received this telecopy in error, please notify the sender immediately to arrange for the return or destruction of these documents. Prior to machine-to-machine fax transmissions, the integrity of the system will be validated to assure protection of patient confidentiality. Care must be taken to ensure that faxes are transmitted to the correct recipients. When practical, the sender of a fax should contact the intended recipient to ensure that the fax was correctly received. Internet/Intranet The use of the Internet is a privilege and may be revoked at any time. Each entity is responsible for defining staff who will have access to the Internet and will develop and implement procedures for monitoring appropriateness of use. Authorized users are encouraged to use the Internet to its fullest potential to discover new ways to use resources, enhance services, and promote staff development. Inappropriate use of the Internet/Intranet includes, but is not limited to: Unlawful activity Misrepresentation of oneself or Duke Medicine Communications with the media without appropriate approval from Public Relations/Communications Carrying out personal business Other activities that could cause congestion and/or disruption of network and systems Access to or the creation and/or transmission of documents incorporating any offensive material, including but not limited to any material which may be considered obscene, pornographic, discriminatory, defamatory, harassing, threatening, profane or indecent, via the Internet or Intranet network is prohibited. Text Paging and Messaging Traditional text paging messages and Short Message Services (SMS) are more immediate and less intrusive than other methods of communication, but they are also less secure and reliable. Entity communication procedures will balance the benefits of timeliness and efficiency against the requirements of patient safety and privacy. Limited PHI may be included in text pager messages BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND/OR HOSPITAL STAFF when it will directly benefit patient care. Unencrypted text messages may not be sent to patients. Use alternative method of communication such as Duke MyChart or secure email. Pager messages may be used to alert and inform providers, but may not be the sole means of transmitting medical orders. Information or instructions received in a pager message must be confirmed by other means before action is taken. Text pager messages should be sent through encrypted transmission methods when they are available and reliable. These include text messages to cell phones via SMS; to smartphones and similar devices via SMS, native messaging services (e.g. iMessage) or encrypted email; and to two-way pagers.
prompt: When the Medical Record Number is made up of the Social Security Number, only the last four digits may be sent., completion:  Team Communication in Maestro Care (also known as "Sticky Notes") Team communication is used to inform members of the patient care team of non-urgent /non-emergent matters. The communication is an initial pathway to inform/remind a team member of an issue where the response may wait hours prior to review. Team communication note is not a progress note. Not used to communicate clinical information which requires intervention in the next 24 hours. Not to be used to convey treatment needs, i.e. orders, results or referrals. No PHI is necessary as the communication is contained in the patient’s medical record. Team communication is NOT a permanent part of the patient’s medical record, however, it remains part of the record unless deleted. Once addressed, receiver of communication note should delete note. Appropriate uses of a “Team Communication” are limited to: immunization screening review, patients and/or family request for meeting/information, reminders to renew non-urgent medication. Inappropriate uses include: communication of patient results such labs, vital signs, change in patient status, or any clinically time sensitive information. Voice Mail While Voice Mail is a convenient means to leave a message for a recipient who is not immediately available, it should be considered less secure as it may be possible for someone other than the intended recipient to retrieve the message (e.g. if sent to a shared mailbox, or if the recipient has a easy to guess PIN). Members of the Duke Health Enterprise Workforce must set a PIN code that is not easily guessed on any Voice Mail service that they use for Duke Health Enterprise business. This includes both Duke Health Enterprise-provided Voice Mail, as well as personal Voice Mail services (e.g. through their cell phone provider). Limited PHI may be included in a voice mail message BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND/OR HOSPITAL STAFF when it will directly benefit patient care. Voice Mail containing PHI should be promptly deleted when no longer needed to facilitate patient care. If a Voice Mail mailbox is shared between multiple parties, the departmental manager must: Set the PIN and share it with the appropriate team members. Change the PN at least every 180 days, or when a team member with access to the PIN leaves the department, whichever comes first. Voice Mail Between Providers and Patients (or a Guardian Who Represents a Patient) For appointment reminders, minimal information needed to remind a patient of an appointment must be used. For all other communications, minimal information needed to alert the recipient of the need for and urgency of a call back or other contact with the caller will be used ** To ensure this is the most recent version of the Duke Health Electronic Communication Policy, please log into eGRC and check Policy Tracking ID: 205829 Using Directory Services on Duke Cisco 8821 Wireless Phones and other 88XX Models The Directory service has changed on the newer Cisco Model 88xx series phones to separate call logging from actual directory services. This document explains how to use directory services on the new 88xx models and also where to find call logging for placed and missed calls. Section 1         Contacts There are two functions within the Contacts feature: Personal Directory: You can save personal contacts in your personal directory. The system protects your personal directory with a user ID and a PIN that you set up.

In general, we understand the value in utilizing email authentications methods such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, but we also understand there are challenges and pain points that go along with implementation.  We take these issues seriously as we continue to strive to make a better email environment for Duke.
prompt: What is SPF?, completion:  The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an open standard specifying a technical method to prevent sender address forgery. More precisely, the current version of SPF — called SPFv1or SPF Classic — protects the envelope sender address, which is used for the delivery of messages.  (http://www.openspf.org/Introduction)
prompt: How is SPF Applied?, completion:  SPF records are published via TXT records in DNS. SPF Enforcement SPF Enforcement deals with inbound email, or Duke as an email recipient.  As a mail server that is accepting mail from other mail systems our responsibility is SPF enforcement, or in other words we have the responsibility to query these TXT records to verify the sender address is not forged. Accordingly, we have the responsibility to enforce the sending domain's published policy if they provide an SPF record. SPF Publishing SPF Publishing deals with outbound email, or Duke as a sender.  As an organization sending mail we can publish a SPF record in our own DNS and ask that other organizations adhere to our published policy
prompt: What is Duke's stance on SPF?, completion:  Beginning on August 9, 2017 Duke began enforcing SPF on inbound emails on the OIT run gateways that sit in front of most Duke email domains.  SPF enforcement in this way does not impact your ability to send mail from your @duke.edu email. With activation of this SPF enforcement we began bouncing messages from senders whose sending address failed SPF validations.  Rejecting messages that produce an SPF Hard Fail is considered best practice (http://www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax). Effective November 2, 2017 in addition to generating a bounce to the sender indicating the message has failed SPF validations, we also began making these messages available to the recipient through their Proofpoint quarantine.  For more information on quarantine, please visit KB0026213. It is important to note that this enforcement/bouncing of the messages is not a decision that Duke is making in a vacuum, we are simply applying the rules that a sending domain asks us to for mail coming from their domains. The only messages being rejected are those which Hard Fail SPF which is caused by the sender publishing a “-all” condition in their SPF record. We will continue to work with outside senders to resolve the issues with SPF enforcement.  Thus far, each case of failed delivery due to SPF enforcement has been due to actual SPF failures that the sender needed to address. At this time, we do not publish a SPF record for the duke.edu domain. This means that if you set up a third party to send mail from @duke.edu addresses you should not run into SPF issues on the receiving end. However; and it’s a big However, we do plan on publishing SPF in the future. Since SPF is in our plans it is important that we, OIT/EIS, understand where you are sending mail from.  We would like to know so that we can ensure these places are included as we walk towards SPF publishing.  It will make both of our lives easier in the long run if you let us know up front.   In general, we discourage the use of sending mail using @duke.edu as a sending address when using third parties.  If you do use @duke.edu then please ensure that you consider bounces/undeliverable/replies.  In other words, please do not send from bogus email addresses. If you are going to use a third party to send emails we do encourage you to use a subdomain for this purpose.  The same guidance applies there regarding sending from bogus addresses.  If you are going to use a third level domain, aka subdomain, then OIT can assist you, if needed, with publishing a SPF record for that subdomain.  As with any SPF implementation the trick is understanding any/all mailers that send from the domain in use. Additional Information/Discussion/Contact If you’d like to discuss SPF implementation and/or DKIM/DMARC, or if you have questions, please reach out to eis-staff@duke.edu, contact the OIT Service Desk (help@duke.edu | 919-684-2200), or submit a ServiceNow request and we would be happy to chat with you about it.

PACE is the Protected Analytic Computing Environment. The system is composed of virtual machines, in an isolated network segment, designed to reduce the risk of accidental data loss or PHI disclosure. Researchers log into their PACE workstations, work with protected data either alone or with others in shared spaces, and when needed, export the data via an honest-broker process. The Honest Broker reviews the information being exported and confirms it meets the terms of the regulating IRB before moving it "outside" of PACE. Instructions for requesting a new PACE workstation, and requirements for approval, are found elsewhere in this document. Training Video: For new users, we recommend starting with the Pace Intro video https://deduce.duhs.duke.edu/webDoc/helpDesk/pace/PACE%20intro%20module/story_html5.html Offline Documentation: A supplemental summary training document is available as an attachment to this KB Article.

prompt: What are contact or registration types when it comes to Cvent? These are categories of users who need a different experience when they register. For example, you may have an event open to the public where anyone can attend. Within this event, there may be components or "sessions" that are not open to anyone who registers - they are restricted. This could apply to a community breakfast or an advisory board meeting. Other relevant examples include events where the fees differ depending on the classification of the attendee (i.e. adult vs youth). Cvent provides contact or registration types that you can enable so that you can guide this registration process as needed., completion:  Keep in mind that you can structure your event so that the attendee will never see the contact type you have associated with this registration experience (or setting). For that reason, we recommend using generic contact types when configuring your event. Follow these steps to enable contact types for your event. Go to Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration. In the section labeled Registration Process, make sure Registration Types is active. If it is not, click the Edit button and enable it making sure to save changes. Go to Event Details -> General -> Registration Types and click Edit. Click the button Add from Contact Types. Select any contact types that are relevant for your event. For example, you can enable the generic Path 1 and Path 2 to be used "behind the scenes". Or you could enable a contact type that fits your needs such as Faculty, Staff, or Student. Click the Save button to apply the updates. TIP: as you configure your event, you can add or remove contact types as needed. You are now ready to use these categories as you configure the event. As a next step, you can create Registration Settings that associated with each contact type. The Duke template includes generic images that will work for most events but changing the header image and even some of the text elements does help differentiate your event from others. Here are some things you can do to modify the user experience. Change the header image Click the Admin button at the top of the page. Click the Libraries link where you should be at the Media folder. Search for your group's folder and if one does not exist, use the Add Folder button to create one (each department should use only one folder for all media images). The folder name should be in UPPER case and obviously associated with your department. Be aware the new folder is created but may not be visible unless you scroll to the bottom of the page. NOTE: if your department folder is not present and you do not have the option to create a new folder, contact dukecvent@duke.edu. Go into your folder and upload any images you wish to use for your event include header images. IMPORTANT: each item uploaded should start with the name of your department folder followed by the file name (ex. DEPARTMENT_filename). Navigate back to your event which may be available under Recent Items. Go to Website & Registration -> Website -> Event Website. Click the Layout tab and then the Header region. In the Image field, click the "..." menu and locate your folder, then image, and click Insert. Your custom header should now be visible when you click the Preview option. There are many other things you can modify about your event but be aware that the Duke template was generated with advanced CSS code. It is possible to modify your theme settings so that you can use "Basic" options to modify colors. However, if you do this you may affect how your event website appears on a mobile device. You can also modify the CSS code if you are comfortable with web design. If you are not, you may want to leave the template as it is.

prompt: How do I use Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA) when I want to access Duke's Virtual Private Network(VPN)?, completion:  After February 6, whenever you want to access the Duke University VPN, you will have to use MFA to connect. Follow these step to connect to Duke's VPNs. Go to your Cisco AnyConnect VPN client or to https://portal.duke.edu Choose your VPN using the dropdown arrow and click Connect. 3. Enter your NetID and NetID password and click OK. 4. After February 6, you will see another screen with an MFA option field (See image below). Enter the number that corresponds to the MFA option you'd like. Depending on how many devices you have registered, you may see a different number of options. For example, * Type 1 if you want to authenticate with your DUO app. This is the most portable option and also allows for access if you don’t have service or Wi-Fi in your area. * Type 2 if you want to authenticate with a phone call.You will receive a call asking you to press a number. Once you press a number, you will be connected to the VPN. * Type 3 if you want to receive ten codes via text. Each code can only be used once. These codes are active for three days. Enter one of those codes into the MFA Option field, click Continue, and you will be connected to the VPN. * If you want to use your YubiKey, make sure your cursor is in the MFA Option field, then touch the gold button. Your code will automatically be entered and you will be connected to the VPN. 5. You should now be connected to the VPN. You can verify by seeing if the Cisco AnyConnect icon in your dock has a small lock. ************* If you'd like to see what devices you have registered for MFA, follow the steps below. 1. Log into https://idms-mfa.oit.duke.edu/mfa/home and click on "View Devices," you'll see the order in which your devices are registered. This order will determine the order of options you see in step 4 above. In the case where you have a smartphone but you did not activate your Duo Mobile app, you or a Service Desk Analyst can use the NetID proxy tool to access and manage your MFA settings. If you'd like to activate a device, follow the steps below. 1. Once in the MFA settings homepage, click Replace your existing phone or tablet with a new device. 2. Next, click on the device you want to activate, then on the next page click Continue without changing any fields (unless you have a new number). 3. On the next page, click Send links to my phone. This will send two text messages; the first one with the Duo Mobile app install link and the second text with the activate app link. Now you can open the app and follow the steps at the top of this page to connect to the VPN. If you don’t have your device, you can obtain temporary passcodes by going to https://idms-mfa.oit.duke.edu/mfa/bypass/ . This batch of passcodes will expire in three days. If you need assistance, please contact the OIT Service Desk at 919.684.2200 Once you have configured your event, you want to let your audience know about it. And how you do that depends on the type of event you are having. There are public events welcome for anyone to register and there are private events where the "guest" list is restricted. Once you determine your event type, you can decide what method works best for notifying your audience. Sending Invitations using Cvent Cvent provides support for sending event invitations directly to your registrants. This is done via Invitation lists. If you want the recipient to be identified by name within the email with a customized registration link that preserves information about the invitee, you will want to use Invitation Lists. Members of these lists are tracked so you can determine if the recipient accepted or declined the invitation or if there was no response. However, you don't add individuals to these lists. You populate them by importing members of groups which are managed with the central Contacts directory. However, because the central Contacts Address Book is a shared resource among all Cvent planners, there are restrictions on how users are added to this central listing. Contact groups imported from DADD Using the Segmentation tool within DADD (Duke Alumni Development Database), you can enter a query to generate a list of users who meet your search terms. Once you have determined the query is generating the correct results, you can enable to option to propagate your group to the Cvent Address Book. If the user is not present in the Address Book, they will be added. If they are present, they will be included in your group. If they no longer meet the criteria, they will be removed from your group in Cvent but will remain present in the Address Book. Follow this process for importing contact groups from DADD. Verify that an existing Cvent contact groups or combination of groups will not meet your needs. Go to https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_afUYWimu9PXdRrv and complete the form. Your group will be created with a particular naming convention of "DEPARTMENT-groupname" (for example: "DAA_Fall Seminar" or "DAA-Fall-Seminar"). After the query has been added to the Segmentation Tool, verify the group is being populated in Cvent. Importing contacts not present in the Address Book. You may find that those you wish to invite are not present in DADD and are not included in the Address Book. In these cases, you will need to submit a request to dukecvent@duke.edu or contact the Service Desk indicating you need contacts imported into Cvent. Please provide a spreadsheet that contains an Email Address, First Name, Last Name and the Duke Unique ID number (OPTIONAL). Please allow 5 business days for your request to be completed. Requesting a contact group be created The Cvent "Address Book" is shared among all Duke Cvent users (planners). For that reason, the permission to create or modify contacts or groups within it is limited and controlled. This is necessary to minimize duplication of user records and reduce "bad entries" such as blank names. Email dukecvent@duke.edu including a descriptive name for your group (for example: "Fall Seminar"). Please limit group names to alpha-numeric characters with the exception of spaces, hyphens, and underscores. Your group will be created with a naming convention of "DEPARTMENT-groupname" (for example: OIT_Fall Seminar" or "OIT-Fall-Seminar"). Populating Invitation lists using the Address Book If your event is open to anyone, your best option is to use WebLinks which can be included in mass email solutions or which can be linked from a website. However, if all or part of your event is private, you will need to create Invitation Lists. The Invitation Lists are also necessary to validate who can register for parts of your event that are restricted. You can manually select individuals from the Contacts address book to be added to a list. You can also select a Contact Group and import all the members to your Invitation List. Once the list is created, users can register for the event and they are found in the Invitation List, their status will be updated. Within your event, go to Promotion & Communication -> Email -> Invitation Lists. Click the button Create Invitation List. Provide a Name and optionally a Description. In the Email Options section, verify the From name and Email Address. Unless necessary, do not modify Advanced Settings section. For example, if you are using Registration Types you can assign that value in this section. Save changes. Click the List Members button and select Add Contacts from Address Book. Click the drop-down list by Contact group and select your contact group. Click the box by each name that should be added. To select all, click the check box in the header row. Click the Add button and the Confirm button when prompted to add the users to the list. NOTE: These users are not emailed at this time even though you will see "no response" in Status. Create a weblinks for your event. For public events, Weblinks are a simple option for registrants. Weblinks are URLs that take the user to specific registration pages. This option is attractive in that your recipients do not have to exist in the Cvents Contacts list. You can use other email providers to send your invitation or you can add the link to a website. You can also create Weblinks associated to specific Registration Paths. Follow this procedure to create Weblinks for your event. Within your event, go to Promotion & Communication -> Web -> Weblinks. Weblinks related to different parts of your event already created and ready for use. However, you cannot test them until your event is launched. Once "live", you can test the various weblinks. Summary: This is a link to a page that provides a summary of your event. This page also includes a "Register" button. Event agenda: Unless you've enabled the Agenda page, this link will take visitors to the Summary page. Registration: This link will take a visitor directly to the first registration page bypassing the Summary. You can also create custom links. This is useful if you have multiple registration paths or want to link to other event pages such as the Contact Us page. Click the button Create Link. Provide a Name for your link that indicates why it's needed (for example: "Path 2"). OPTIONAL: provide a Reference ID (this is appended to the URL and allows you to run reports on which registrants used this link to register). Select the target of the URL with the In the If invitees arrive from this link, they will go to the: Landing Page: if this option is chosen you can select which of the "tabs" will be the target of the URL with the default being the "Summary" page. Many options are available including Invitation, FAQ, Speakers, etc. Registration Path: if this option is chosen, you can select which "path" should be activated for the registrant. WARNING: the email address used during registration must be associated with an Invitation List. Otherwise, the parts of the event that are restricted will not be visible to the registrant. Click Save. If you event is launched, you can test the URL. Using social media for your event. Cvent allows event planners to embed social sharing links on the event website and/or encourage registrants to share once their registration process is complete. The event planner can upload the Event Image, Post Title, Post Text, Event hashtag, whether or not to display a share bar on the event website (and where on the page it would be placed), and whether or not to prompt registrants to share. IMPORTANT: As an event planner, you may not be interested in Social Media. But be aware if someone posts a link to your event, images that are associated with this feature may be displayed which may not be in keeping with the look of your event. You should take steps to update the content associated with Social Media. If it is not enabled, go to Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration. Click Edit and enable Social Media then Save changes. Within your event, go to Promotion & Communication -> Web -> Social Media. Update the information on the Sharing tab. Click the Edit button and at a minimum update or remove the Event Image and update the fields in the Basic Information box. Modify the Post Title and optionally enter Post Text. NOTE: you are limited to 1000 characters in the Post Text. Modify the Twitter Post Text as appropriate (115 characters available). Provide a hashtag. This will be included in your posts and does count against the 115 character limit. You can include a Share Bar on your event website which permits users to make posts on social media sites. Cvent allows you to determine where this Share Bar is located and you can provide a Reference ID which will allow you track how this share bar was used. Click No if you do not want a Share Bar. You can enable a Share Prompt. This will encourage registrants to share the event after they complete the registration and you can provide a Reference ID which will allow you track how this share prompt was used. Modify these settings as appropriate. Click No if you do not want a Share Prompt. Save changes. If you do not plan to use Social Media, you can disable the feature at Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration. REMINDER: if someone posts a link to your event on social media sites the updates you made should be reflected. Select the Following tab and if changes need to be made, click the Edit button. Indicate if the Follow Bar will be displayed (this allows users to link their social media profiles with your organization). If activated, indicate which social media services will be displayed. Select the Feeds tab and update the information if you plan to publish event-related posts, then Save changes. There is a known issue between Cvent and Facebook where the name of the event is not being updated correctly. Please see this article to get the latest information on what needs to be done to facilitate the update Cvent: New User Training Guide Are you new to Cvent? There are several resources to help as you’re getting started. Cvent offers videos and articles with step-by-step instruction in Help & Support. We recommend searching for an item you are curious about any time. To get started, though, there are several catalogs of resources that you should look at first.

Check regularly for updated messages. The Cvent Media Library is the collection of images, audio files and Flash files for event designers to use recurringly. Cvent users with designer access will maintain the files for their user group. Duke filing system The folders will be used based on the following standards: The folder name will be the name of the user group as it is assigned for the user roles. The folder name will not include the name Duke. For example, Gardens instead of Duke Gardens. All files related to the user group will be named with the naming convention FOLDERNAME_file name Only the users with the planner/designer role may access the Media Library.
prompt: Do not create new folders., completion:  NOTE: The DAA will have the following 3 folders - DAA (all other DAA events); DAA Regional (regional headers/graphics that are constantly used); DAA Reg Events (regional event graphics that can be cleaned out after use). It is recommended that users use the Search component of the Media Library to search for the images within the folder. A folder is available for all users: General.
prompt: What features does Cvent have?, completion:  Online event registration paid or no-cost events Contact database for invited and registered lists Duke Alumni Development Database integration (limited) Real-time event registration reports Customizable event registration websites Customizable event emails Protected login with Duke NetID and password
prompt: How long does it take to launch an event registration site?, completion:  A: A new user should plan for two months from the time they first login to the time the event registration site is ready to collect live registrations. After the first event has been created, it could take between a couple of hours and a couple of days to prepare a new event.
prompt: Can one event be copied for another event without having to re-create it from scratch?, completion:  A: Yes. Event planners will create an event from an Event template, which is a saved format for registrations in your department. Events will not be created from scratch and will start by copying from a select template. Departments can have multiple event templates.
prompt: Can I log into Cvent with my netID?, completion:  A: Yes. And only Duke affiliates with a netID can use Cvent at Duke. Is Cvent at Duke cloud hosted? A: Yes. And the data maintenance and infrastructure has been vetted and meets the Duke security and standards protocol.
prompt: Can I export the registration data?, completion:  A: Yes. Many reports are available out-of-the-box with Cvent OR reports can be genereated based on the custom criteria or specifications you need. Reports can be excel, pdf, csv, word or mhtml (web archive). Check updates for new features such as a Report Portal for real-time reports via a URL.
prompt: Who can see the registration data for events I manage?, completion:  A: Event planners can restrict who has access to their events to people in their department (see Event Visiblity tab under Event Configuration). The Cvent support team at OIT can see all events. If specific access to a site or resource (that is "outside" the PN) is needed from a VM *within* the PN, it may be possible for that to be enabled.  The two potential options are (1) to utilize the Protected Network's squid proxy or (2) a firewall exception. Which of those two options should I request? If the application that needs Internet access can use HTTP/S for that connection AND that application can be configured to point to a proxy, the preferred method of leveraging the squid proxy should be requested.  Otherwise, a firewall exception can be requested. I believe that I can utilize the squid proxy (option 1 above) for access; how do I request that? Configure the application to use "pn-proxy.oit.duke.edu:3128" as the proxy server (and port).  It is possible that the squid proxy is ALREADY CONFIGURED to allow access to the outside resource (if that resource is part of the "Universal Allow" whitelist, for example).  If that is the case, your access will "just work" at this point.  If it does NOT, proceed to step B... Submit a "New Generic Request" Service Now ticket, assigned to "Security-University", that stipulates the FQDN of the PN VM that needs outbound connectivity, the FQDN of the "outside" resource, the protocol(s)/port(s) that the request will be using (e.g., TCP/443), and a brief statement of why the access is needed.  Here's a screenshot of a previous request as an example: Using the squid proxy is not an option in this instance; how do I instead request a firewall exception? Visit https://cartographer.oit.duke.edu/firewall/requests/ and select the + New Firewall Request button near the top left. Fill in the subsequent form with sufficient detail to allow the ITSO to determine if this request should be approved.

prompt: Can remove a flyer, which removes the flyer from public pool and all feeds, completion:  You entered _ for "Scanned Sheets of Paper", but the scanning device sent _ sheets.  Please scan missing sheets or update "Scanned Sheets of Paper" attribute under the "Scan Attributes" tab. Solarity scan is reporting less sheets of paper scanned than the images are showing on the screen. Cause / Workaround This alert is generated to alert the scan user that clinical documentation may be missing from the batch. If this happens occasionally, it is okay, and no ticket should be submitted. Communications issues can occur between the scanner, the workstation, and the Solarity Scan application. The scanner by default scans both sides of every page. The Solarity Scan application performs a page count calculation based on the number of images that are sent from the scanner to the Solarity Scan application.  The number of images Solarity Scan receives is in the header of Solarity Scan; it displays the count of Non-Blank, Blank, and Deleted images. For Solarity Scan to not generate the error, the total of all Images fields must equal 2 times the number of pages.  2*Sheets of Paper = Non-Blank Images + Blank Images + Deleted Images. If 1 piece of paper is scanned, the scanner sends 2 images to Solarity Scan.  If 6 sheets of paper are scanned, the Solarity Scan application expects 12 images.  If Solarity Scan only receives 11 images from the scanner, the page count will read as 5 pages in Solarity Scan, and Solarity Scan will generate an alert. If an alert is received, validate that each scanned page is in the batch images on the left side of the screen in Solarity Scan.  If all images are present, adjust the number of pages in the Batch Attributes section.  If pages are missing, scan the additional images. If this happens on EVERY batch scanned by this workstation, the Scanner Drivers are not configured correctly, and a ticket needs to be submitted to Device Support to install an updated driver package for the scanner. Solarity Scan relies on each image being sent to the application, including blank pages. If the scanner is configured to drop blank pages, this will cause issues within Solarity Scan. Solarity Training Materials can be downloaded from this Knowledgebase article: https://duke.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0028528 If this is only happening occasionally, advise the user to follow the steps above, and close the ticket. If this is happening on every batch that is scanned, please route the ticket to the appropriate device support team to check the version of the Kodak Driver that is on this workstation.

C-SATS is a tool that allows for the review of surgical technique and process through laparoscopic and robotic surgical cameras, which provides the opportunity for measuring and improving the technical skills of surgeons. This is currently a 6 month Pilot program.  This application contains no PHI or SEI. Only scope video from inside the patient is recorded/transmitted. If the scope/video captures anything outside the patient, advanced machine learning is enabled to immediately blur/black out that feed so that none of that is recorded or submitted to the C-SYNC server/cloud. The application interface itself only captures case details such as physician name and type of surgery, with no PHI included., completion:  SOFTWARE TECHNICAL SUPPORT C-SATS is a vendor supported system. The users  are the primary Administrators and handle all account management and problem items themselves, or they contact C-SATS directly at 888-630-9748 .

prompt: How to uninstall Box Drive, completion:  Box Drive is an easy way to work with all of your desktop files without taking up much hard drive space. You can find every file you need through Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. You can edit the file as if it were local and automatically save it to the cloud, all with the protection of enterprise-grade security. Reference: https://www.box.com/drive,  https://community.box.com/t5/Box-Drive-Public-Beta-Resource/ct-p/BoxDrive Both Box Drive and Box Sync provide users the ability to access Box content from the desktop environment. There are a few differences between the applications that are listed below. Note: There are known issues with having both Box Sync and Box Drive installed on a single machine. We recommend uninstalling Box Sync before installing Box Drive. Please see the article "Box.com: Before installing Box Drive, uninstall Box Sync". Box Drive Box Drive allows users to access all of their Box folders/files in their desktop Box folder. Box does not currently support making files available for offline access. This will be a feature in future version, but currently users needing this feature should use Box Sync to work on files while offline. Note: Box Drive does locally cache files that the user has opened. Box Drive's cache size limit is based on your free disk space (50% of available space) and has a maximum limit of 25 GB. Once this limit has been reached, files that have gone un-accessed the longest will be removed first. Also, if a cached file has a new version created on Box, Box Drive will discard the locally cached version. Box Sync See the charts below for more details on the current differences between Box Sync and Box Drive: End-User Functionality: Box Drive Box Sync Search & view all the content in your Box account (including read-only) ✓ Upload content to any Box folder/ Open files from any Box folder Lock content for editing Mark content for offline access Create and retrieve a Shared link Change the location of the Box folder on your computer Admin Functionality: Device Pinning Device Trust Box Verified Enterprise Auto-updates without user requiring admin rights Virtual Desktop Support: Configuration Box Drive Published apps x* Remote Desktop VDI (persistent) VDI (non-persistent) x *Both Box Sync and Box Drive only work if you are running on client PC (not on RDS/Terminal Services server) and client drive mapping from RDS/Terminal Services server must be enabled to save content into Box.

prompt: Do not run Box Sync and box Drive at the same time., completion:  Box Drive does not currently support marking files for offline access. This feature will be available in future versions of Box Drive, until then, if you need to access certain files while disconnected from the internet, we recommend using Box Sync. Large files may take longer than expected to open for the first time. Initial loading of a folder's content may take time, especially for very large folders. Multiple users on the same device or workstation will not both be able to use Box Drive simultaneously. Box Drive will not open for the second user until the first user quits Box Drive. Box Search UI fails to remember its new location on reopening if the user drags it from the default location. Unsupported characters in folder or file names will cause issues, such as errors, when copying them into Box Drive. Copying the Box Notes file from Box Drive might fail. In such cases, retrying the copy operation will help. Attempting to open multiple PDF files from the Box Drive search interface may result in an error. Customers using security products such as the ones listed below, may see unexpected behavior with Box Drive if the security product cannot exclude Box Drive's volume mount using the "Box" folder path. McAfee MOVE Symantec DLP Checkpoint Endpoint Encryption BitDefender Box Drive is not compatible with the following applications/programs and may result in unexpected behavior: Adobe Bridge - attempting to open the Box folder from Adobe Bridge will result in an error.

One of the stages of an Emma Campaign is determining the target audience (recipients) of an email distribution. These recipients can be added in several ways. The preferred method for Duke recipients is to create a group in Group Manager that can be replicated to Emma. It is also possible to directly add contacts to an Emma account. There are many features associated with the AUDIENCE feature of Emma. For the purposes of this document, we will cover adding contacts and adding them to a group. Follow these steps to set up your recipients for an email campaign. Adding Contacts Login to Emma and click the AUDIENCE tab. The default landing page is CONTACTS which lists all individual email addresses. You can click the button ADD CONTACT to create a single contact record. You must provide an email address and can also add First Name and Last Name. On the right, the Groups you have created are listed and you can select all the groups where the contact should be included. Keep in mind that a user can belong to multiple groups and even if all groups are included in a mailing, the contact will receive only one copy of the message. If you have no groups created but wish to use them, click the CREATE GROUP button. Provide a name for the group (avoid special characters). You can also indicate if this is a test group (these contain up to 10 email addresses and are used for testing mailings before they're sent). To add your contact, you can either click SAVE AND CLOSE which exits the process or SAVE AND ADD ANOTHER which allows you to continue adding contacts. If you have a large number of contacts to add, you can click IMPORT. For your first import, you will be reminded that the buying or renting of user lists is not permitted and you should not import someone who has asked not to receive your emails. You can upload a file containing your contacts either by dragging the icon into the window or you can click Choose File. The import process recognizes files in supported formats of xls, xlsx, or csv. You need to indicate what the import process should do for existing contacts. You can elect to have this record skipped or you can have the record updated. This is useful if you want to add existing contacts to new groups. The import process will attempt to map your data to contact fields (First Name, Last Name, and Email address). It will also skip the headers if you have them. Other columns in your file will be ignored. You can either create a new group as the target of your import or select an existing group. Review the report summary, then click Import to start the process. The importing process speed will vary depending on the size of your file and number of records. When the process is completed, the import status will either show a green check for success or a red "X" for problems. For problem imports, you can View error to see what the issues were and how to correct them. You can switch to the CONTACTS view to see what was added. Click ERRORS to see if there were issues with any email addresses. This is very helpful in identifying issues with incorrect email addresses. Defining Segments SEGMENTS are dynamic groups. Segments are populated based on certain criteria. For example, you can create a segment that identifies contacts in your account that are not associated with any group (Emma calls this "Limbo"). Follow these steps to create this type of segment. Select SEGMENTS and the button CREATE A SEGMENT. You may be presented with a process guide or "Wizard" that will take you through creating your first segment. Provide a name for your segment avoiding special characters (ex. "Contacts not in groups"). Click the Segment type dropdown menu and select Group. In the second dropdown menu, select Not in. In the third dropdown menu, select Limbo (not in any group). The process will provide a projected total of contacts not in a group with a percentage of the audience. Click SAVE to keep the segment or CANCEL to exit the process. NOTE: you can continue to add criteria for your search by selecting the AND and OR buttons.

Application: CBord (DUH) Service Offering: Inpatient General Apps Offering Assign ticket to: Core Clinical Applications-DHTS or Account Management-DHTS One feature that distinguishes Emma from the OIT Mass Email service is that the Emma service has the ability to give you statistics about your recipients and how they interacted with your mailings. This also separates Emma from other methods for distributing information such as Sympa mailing lists. You have the option in Sympa of sending an announcement to all subscribers but you have no idea if your message was read, shared, or if any links in the email were accessed. Emma can tell you much more. Any team member in your Emma subaccount should be able to view the statistics for messages. You may want to set permissions for some team members so that campaign data is the only information they can see. Login to Emma and click the Response tab. The default view is MAILINGS. You can see overall information such as the number of recipients and the date the message was sent. Click the name of the mailing you want to review to access statistics in greater detail. The next window that appears is Overview. This page gives you a summary of how the recipients interacted with your message. These include: Mailing Score - This displays 24 hours after a mailing is sent. This is calculated using factors in open rate, click-through rate, shares percentage, opt-out percentage and signup percentage to give you a number on a 10-point scale and compare it to the community average. Opens by device - You can see if the message was opened on computers or mobile devices (tablets are listed under mobile). Opens by client - You can get a general idea of the email client used to view your email. NOTE: Webmail clients such as Outlook on the Web may appear under Unknown. Click analysis - Your email will be displayed with an overlay of where the recipients clicked. This can help you determine the best place for image, text, and link placement for future mailings. You can also display this information as a list by clicking List. This option will display all clicks ranked from most to least popular. Click the Opens tab to see a listing of the recipients who opened the mailing and when they did. Select the Clicks tab to see a report of all recipients who clicked links in the message. You can also filter your report by clicking the down arrow by All Links to select a particular link in your email. NOTE: for those with permissions that include Audience access, you can see the history and record of each recipient by clicking the down-arrow at the end of each line. Click the Opt-outs page to see any users who click the Unsubscribe link in the message. IMPORTANT: be aware that if a user unsubscribes or "opts out" of your emailings, that you cannot override this setting, even with highest privileges. The user must elect to receive emails again. You can use COMPARE MAILINGS to review user responses to different mailings. This is especially helpful if you are sending content on a regular basis (ex. weekly newsletters). Select at least two mailings. Click the Compare button and select which report you want created. Performance summary - provides details of the response data. Click summary - shows how many clicks each link received. Classic summary - compares the response results (up to 5 mailings). The results will be downloaded for comparison. Click the REPORTS link to see data represented visually. Select your date range using the Date pickers. You can also select presets such as Group by month and Group by day. Graphs should refresh on the page which include data on the Open Rate, Click Rate, Bounce Rate, and Opt-Out Rate for you account mailings. Click the Camera icon to save the graph as a PNG file. Rich Media Playback Podcasts (RSS)/ Mobile Playback Notes and Bookmarks Panopto recordings played back through a web browser on your laptop a rich media viewer that includes a number of advanced features that leverage the power of search. For an overview of the Panopto viewer, see https://support.panopto.com/s/article/viewing-0. Here are some additional tips about viewing DukeCapture-Panopto recordings: Your instructor or event organizer will provide you with the URLs to your recordings. If DukeCapture prompts you to log in, choose NetID from the drop down menu and enter your NetID and password. You can enter time based text notes (aka bookmarks) as you watch the recording and then search those notes. For more information on taking notes (either live or when watching a previously recorded session), click here (https://support.panopto.com/s/article/taking-notes-1) The presenter may decide to make their recording available via audio podcast or video vodcast through Apple Podcasts or via RSS feeds. Contact your presenter (faculty member) for more information as to this availability. In addition to creating Rich Media versions of recordings, Panopto also has the ability to automatically generate video and audio podcasts  that can be accessed either via individual links, or via RSS feeds you can import into iTunes or other media players that handle RSS. Many recordings created at Duke in Panopto automatically have podcasts created in addition to Rich Media. If you have questions about whether your recordings are configured to create podcasts, or if you have questions about how you can access your Panopto podcasts, contact your Site Administrator. If you are logged in to Panopto, you can take and save time-stamped notes while you are watching live and on-demand videos. When you log back in again, they will be visible to you, and you can share them with others if you'd like to. Panopto maintains documentation covering this feature set here: https://support.panopto.com/s/article/taking-notes-1. Bookmarks operate similar to notes, and are explained here: https://support.panopto.com/s/article/social-features-0 Solarity Batch Quality Resolution Request Email If an index user finds an issue with a batch, you may receive a Solarity Batch Quality Resolution Request email.

See the visualization below: Registered Prefix All prefixes for Windows servers must be registered on the Department Registry Page. This prefix should closely match the acronym corresponding to your department. Project Abbreviation This is a 3-4 character abbreviation chosen by the admin and service owner that should uniquely identify a project or logical group of servers Environment, Role Abbreviation, Number The last section of the name will include an environment, role abbreviation, and number. The environment abbreviation corresponds to the environment this server is expected to be running in. Options are: T=Test D=Development P=Production SB = Sandbox The role abbreviation is a 2 character code which corresponds to the role that this system is expected to have. Options are: Role Codes: DB = Database Server AP = Application Server PS = Print Server FS = File Server WS = Web Server F = *( Optional - Failover/Standby designator (F) ) *Note: The Failover/Standby designation is only to be used to designate servers which are both passive and use a manual failover process. Environments with automated failover (including clusters) or active/active servers (loadbalancing) should not use this designation. The final character is a number which allows an application administrator to define multiple server that form the same function. Examples SSI-DCS-TDB1 = First test database server for DCS project which is owned and manged by the SSI department. SSI-DCS-PWS3 = Third production web server for DCS project which is owned and manged by the SSI department. SSI-DCS-PAP1 = First production application server in DCS project which is owned and manged by the SSI department.

What if you have a paper document and you want to use RightFax? Solution If you have access to a scanner, you can leverage the scanner to turn your paper document into a digital document that can be used with RightFax. PAPER + SCANNER = DIGITAL DOCUMENT Below are instructions specific to the Kodak i2600 or i2620 Scanner and using the Windows Fax and Scan application included in Windows 7 and Windows 10. Steps to follow: Turn on your scanner if you haven’t already. Place paper documents on the scanner. The quickest and easiest way to open Windows Fax and Scan is to simply search for it. Just type Windows Fax or WPS from the search bar and you'll see it show up in the search results. Tap or click on it to open it. In Windows 10, the search bar is located next to the Start button. In previous versions of Windows, the search bar may instead by inside the Start button so you may need to click that first before you see it. If you'd rather not search, Windows Fax and Scan is available via the Start menu in every version of Windows: Windows 10: Start button -> Accessories Windows 7: Start Menu -> All Programs Click New Scan in the blue toolbar.  The New Scan window appears after a few seconds. If you get an error the first time, try again once. Change the Color format: to Black and white. The other settings are OK with the defaults. Click Scan. Wait for the scanning process to complete. Windows will give your file a generic name (e.g. Image, Image (2)). You will want to rename the file with a memorable name. Follow these steps to rename the file. Right-click on the recently scanned file and choose Rename... Enter a new memorable name and click OK. Where is my new file? Your new digital document is now located in the Scanned Documents folder of your Documents directory. For example, \Documents\Scanned Documents Follow the KB Article on how to send a fax. In the RightFax Web Client, after you click the Attach File > Browse button, navigate to your new file to attach.

Locate the report you want to share in your "My Reports" library.  Hover over the report and click “Edit”: Click the “General” tab on the report.  You should see a section called “users who can view and run this report”.   If you don't see this section, the person you want to share the report with will need to make a copy of your report instead. Click in this section and enter the name of the user you want to share the report with.  As long as they have the proper security, you can add them here and then press “Save” to share the report with them. The user you shared the report with can now search in their library to find and run the report you’ve shared: If the user you’re trying to add doesn’t have the right security to view your report, you’ll get an error: If you get this error, that user’s manager will need to request that they get access to your report.  Their manager can open up a ticket through Get IT Analytics and Reporting to request this access.  Please include the name of the report and the Report ID of your private report when making this request: To chat with a Service Desk representative, go to the IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu), and then click  Chat. Service Offering: Information Delivery Assign ticket to: ACE Triage-DHTS One way to share private Maestro Care reports is to make a copy of someone else’s private report.  Note that this method is the only way to share private copies of Crystal reports, as Crystal reports cannot be shared with other users on the General tab (see below). Enter the name of the owner of the private report in the “View Another User’s Library” field and press enter.  This field is located in the lower-right corner of the library: Click the “Reports owned by …” filter and/or the search bar to locate the private report you’d like to copy. Once you’ve located the report you want to copy, hover over the report and click “Edit”: Click “Save As”, then “My Library” to save a copy in your own library. Delete the other user’s name from the “View Another User’s Library” field and press enter to return to your own library.  If you search for the new report, you should be able to find and run the copy that you made. If you go back to your library and can’t find the report, you might not have the proper security to view it.  Make sure you’ve clicked the “Clear Filters” button and search again – if you still can’t find it, your manager will need to submit a request through Get IT Analytics and Reporting to request this access.  Please include the name of the report and the Report ID of your private report when making this request: Service Offering: Information Delivery Offering Assign ticket to:  ACE Triage-DHTS To set up out-of-contact: Click Out on the InBasket activity toolbar.

prompt: When DHTS declares a Major Incident for an IT event, electronic communications are sent to a predefined list of emergency preparedness and IT leaders across Duke Health so that they can join a conference bridge to receive ongoing updates.  This communications allows the leaders to decide how to communicate across their entity depending on how they are affected.  This leadership conference bridge provides two-way communications which is critical for understanding the business impact across the Duke enterprise., completion:  The electronic communication includes: A brief description of the service area impacted The Incident number The conference bridge number and access code (stays the same for every incident) Date/ time to join the bridge As long as the Major Incident is unresolved, additional communications to the DHTS leadership response team are sent at agreed to intervals for on-going updates.  Once a "Stand Down" is declared, a final communication is sent to notify all participants that the IT event has been resolved. Additional related information about the DHTS Major Incident Leadership Bridge process: Duke Health: Requesting to be added/removed from the DHTS Leadership Bridge notification list Predefined list of DHTS Leadership Response team participants  (requires DHE NetID/password for access to DHTS Intranet) NOTE:  There are other forms of communication (i.e. IT Alerts on the Duke Health User portal), that are used for specific communication to specific groups in addition to the leadership bridge notifications.  One example of this is the DHTS technical bridge.  It is used to assemble the technical resources during a significant and Major Incident to provide the "all hands on deck" approach to getting the issue resolved. Some other communications methods include but are not limited to 1) using paging web to specific groups like the OA's, 2) updating the automatic phone distribution front end message and 3) defining a pop-up message on PIN stations so clinical users see info when logging in. Any questions regarding the DHTS Major Incident process, please send a service request to Service Management-DHTS.

There are 2 important parts to resolving an incident: Verifying the fix with the customer Updating the incident record with final resolution work notes and performing quality assurance on the data in the incident record Getting Customer Verification Before an incident is resolved, the ticket assignee should do the following: Verify that the customer is satisfied and identify any remaining required activity. Document your availability (day and time) and preferred method of contact as well as the customer response in the Work notes field. If the customer is unavailable on the first attempt, document two additional attempts to contact the customer using a combination of calls and e-mail. While awaiting customer response, set the record to the appropriate Awaiting status. While an incident record is waiting for customer, set the Status field to Awaiting User Info.Note: Per the DHTS Incident Management Policy, this customer verification process may be completed over 7 consecutive calendar days to allow sufficient time for customer response. If the customer responds within the 7-day period (for example on your first contact attempt), resolve the record as soon as the customer confirms that the resolution worked. The 7-day window allows for times when the customer is hard to reach or unavailable and also allows the IT staff to show due diligence in ensuring the customer is happy with the resolution. Performing QA and Resolving the Incident Record In the incident record, verify that the Service Provider, IT Service, Service Offering, Application, and Configuration Item fields makes sense for the issue reported and adjust if needed. The Closure Codes are tied to the IT Service. If the wrong IT Service is identified, you cannot select the most appropriate code. Best practice is to select the most specific code available. The IT-specific Closure Codes are supplied by the Service Owners so that they can accurately trend on items that are resolved. For assignment groups that are not part of DHTS,  if you are unsure of the IT Service to select, leave this field blank or use your best judgement to change it. In the Work Notes field, enter final resolution comments. Any work notes entered during the step when you change the state to Resolved are copied to the Closure Information tab’s Close notes field. You can change or modify these copied values in the Close notes field before the system permanently closes the ticket. The ticket stays in the Resolved status for a ten-day window before automatically closing to allow for quality assurance activities, additional documentation, or recurrence issues. The only exception to this rule is for Major Incidents, which can stay in a Resolved state until the Process Owner marks the Major Incident records Closed after the Major Incident Review is completed. Change the State field to Resolved. In the Closure Code field, choose the best code that describe the action that resolved the Incident. The Closure Codes by IT Service (IT Specific) - List Report lists closure codes by IT service. Click Update at the bottom of the incident record. To submit a request, go to the IT Portal, and click Get IT. To report an IT problem, go to the IT Portal, and click Fix IT.

Exams that a flagged to go to Synaptive can be sent with the following procedure and will need to be verified as acceptable by the system. This verification is accomplished by logging in to the Synaptive web server and verifying the images as PASS or FAIL. Procedure: 1. If an exam is identified as needing to be sent to the Synaptive system, add the notation, "mrsyn01" to the series description of the series that need to go to Synaptive and send the series to DIR1. Also, send images to PACS. 2. Open a web browser and in the URL box, type https://synaptiveweb.dhe.duke.edu. A shortcut can be created for this. 3. When the ImageDrive Clinical login page opens, log in using your DHE credentials. 4. Click on Active Studies(see Figure 1 below). A listing of today's studies will display and indicate if the quality control has Passed or Failed. This check needs to be performed before verifying the patient in PACS and before the patient is off the table. If it has Passed, the study is automatically forwarded to the Planning station and there is nothing more to do. If the study has failed, it will need remediation as indicated on the QC report which can be found by clicking on the paper icon under the word Failed. If images are not going to Synaptive after sending to DIR1, they can also be sent from PACS to the destination named "Synaptive ImageDrive". 5.

Two models of Magewell cards are utilized in current generation capture appliances: Pro Capture Dual HDMI (http://www.magewell.com/products/pro-capture-dual-hdmi) Pro Capture Quad HDMI (http://www.magewell.com/products/pro-capture-quad-hdmi) Support for Magewell cards is initiated via email to Gerard Virga <virga@streamdynamics.net> Two models of Datapath cards are utilized in older generation capture appliances: Datapath vision RGB E1 Datapath Vision RGB E2 Support for these cards is access by emailing support@datapath.co.uk <support@datapath.co.uk>. Communications with Datapath support need to take a 5 hour time difference into account, since Datapath Support is based in the UK. If Media Technologies initiates a support ticket with either vendor, they should cc mailto:cdss-red@duke.edu to keep CDSS informed. If CDSS initiates a support ticket with either vendor, they should cc oit-mt-info@duke.edu to keep Media Technologies informed. *Note--Osprey cards are also utlized in a small number of out of warranty machines. There has never been a need to contact Osprey support, and because these units are no longer officially supported, we do not expect there will be such a need moving forward. Author: Office of Information Technology (OIT) Version 1.0 Approved Categories Category 1 – Operational Support (OIT) Duke’s OIT may use card tracking information to troubleshoot problems with card access security equipment or problems with the ID cards themselves. Category 2 – Security and public safety (DUPD) The DUPD, when investigating a public safety, potential crime, student or employee issue (e.g., domestic violence case), may request DukeCard access records for certain time frames and doors to confirm who had access to a certain area at the time of an incident.  After hours, DUPD may access the system directly for time-critical public safety issues. Approval process The DUPD Chief of Police will provide a list of approved investigators to the DukeCard office.  Approved DUPD investigators may contact the DukeCard Service Manager for DukeCard access information or access the system after hours for time-sensitive public safety issues.  Notification of the request will be provided to the EVP. Constraints The data may only be used as part of an ongoing DUPD investigation and may not be shared outside of those that “need to know” for purposes of the investigation. Data may not be shared with outside law enforcement agencies without approval from Office of Counsel.  Data should be destroyed at the conclusion of the investigation. Category 3 – Space utilization or property issues (schools/departments) The DukeCard office may receive requests for access logs from schools and departments pertaining to how a space is used, or if an issue occurred in a space (e.g., trash left in a room). Requests by the space “owner” involving de-identified or summarized data to analyze space utilization may be requested from the DukeCard office.  Requests will be reviewed and a determination made if a one-time or regular report is warranted. Requests involving unique or identifiable data must carry with them a compelling reason for the data.  Such requests are submitted to the EVP for approval.  Specifically, the following approvals are followed: Requests by the space “owner” for ongoing reports must be approved by the EVP. Requests by the space “owner” for one-time utilization data that is identifiable and will be used for purposes of security/property issue must be submitted by the DUPD (see category 1) Requests by the space “owner” for one-time utilization data that is identifiable and will be used for purposes of space utilization evaluation will be approved by the DukeCard office.  If data linked to access times is needed, it will be submitted to the EVP for approval Requests by the space “owner” for one-time utilization data that is identifiable and will be used for purposes of “room cleanliness” will be denied. Requests by the space “owner” for one-time utilization data that is identifiable and will be used for purposes other than the above will be submitted to the EVP for approval. The data may only be used for the purposes provided.  It may not be shared with any other individuals or departments.  Data for property issues will only be provided for doors that directly control the room in question.  Data must be destroyed at the end of the review. Category 4 – Service improvement requests The DukeCard office may receive requests about access habits for the purpose of improving a service.  For example, the Recreational Center may request information about who is accessing the center to tailor programs to attract more customers. Such a request should come from a department head.  The request should specify what type of information, and a well thought out and descriptive reason for the request.  If the requesting department only asks for de-identified data (e.g. groupings based on affiliation), then a completed Data Use Agreement (DUA) will suffice. If the requesting department asks for identified information including but not limited to name, DUID, email address, home address, telephone, demographic, or gender, then approval must come from the EVP after the DUA is complete.  Approval will not be sought until a complete and compelling case is submitted. The data may only be used as part of the service improvement request and may not be shared outside of those that “need to know” for purposes of the research.  Data may not be shared with anyone else without approval from EVP.  Data must be destroyed at the conclusion of the investigation. Category 5 – Student and Academic Affairs issues There are times when Student Affairs staff need access to DukeCard information for official purposes.  This could be in crisis situations, disciplinary matters, or for health and safety reasons. The on-call staff member most frequently obtains this information; however, a staff member who is not currently on-call but who serves in the on-call rotation could need the information as part of his/her job responsibilities. The staff members who serve in the on-call system report urgent, emergency and crisis situations to the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Vice President for Student Affairs, and Senior Leadership.  Information is obtained via an “Oncall” tool developed by DukeCard, or via a direct request to the DukeCard office. The Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education in Trinity College and The Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering, or their designee, may request card swipe data in event that such data could inform the appropriateness of granting an academic exception/accommodation as requested by a student. The request will come from the Academic Deans and made via a direct request to the DukeCard office. Approval process – Student Affairs Student Affairs provides DukeCard with a list of people authorized to receive DukeCard usage reports for students and access the Oncall application to access the information.  Staff members are trained on how to use the tool and the requirements for confidentiality, including expressly prohibiting the re-disclosure of DukeCard usage to those without a legitimate need to know.  Additionally, it is understood by the on-call staff that DukeCard usage is not to be disclosed to anyone outside of the university, including parents. The data may only be used for crisis, safety, and disciplinary reasons. Data may not be shared with anyone else without approval from EVP.  Data must be destroyed at the conclusion of the investigation. Approval Process – Academic Affairs The respective deans in Trinity College of Arts and Sciences and The Pratt School of Engineering will provide the DukeCard Office with a list of people authorized to receive DukeCard usage reports. Data received will only indicate the usage of a student’s DukeCard during the period in question and used for the sole purpose for which it was requested.  Its use will not extend the stated parameters without the expressed approval of the Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education in Trinity College and The Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering, respectively. The data will be discarded once the academic matter has been resolved. Category 6 – Event attendance Card readers may be checked out and used for attendance at Duke events.  Alternatively, event data may also be collected via apps linked to DukeCard (future). In those cases, attendees MUST be notified that their data is being collected and how it will be used (e.g., to track attendance or to email information after the session).  Attendees must be provided with the reasoning for the access and an opt-out option (provided if there is no compliance reason to track). The specific use of the data must be identified to the Security Office in advance of the event (when the card-access process is requested), including whether the access to data is strictly required for all attendees or optional. The use must be disclosed to attendees at the event, before they access (i.e., students know in the first case that their attendance is recorded due to compliance requirements, or in other optional cases, such as knowing that their email may be added to a mailing list as a result). If the attendee does not wish to consent to the data use being requested, for optional data uses they are allowed to pass through without swiping (such as in the 2nd case) or they are turned away if it is really a requirement. The specific use of the data must be applied in advance of the event.  Attendees must be told how their data will be used.  The data may not be shared with anyone but the event organizers and must be destroyed after use. Other requests The DukeCard office may receive other requests for access to financial or access data.  In those cases, the data request will be reviewed by the CISO and CIO before submission to the EVP for final approval.  It should be noted that requests asking for identifiable data or demographic information (e.g. name, DUID, email address, home address, telephone, demographic, or gender) require a more detailed review than requests for aggregated or de-identified data. Updated: 13-Jul-18 In Compliance with: Duke University Data Classification Standard Duke University Acceptable Use Policy Authority Duke University Chief Information Officer (CIO) Duke University Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Scope: Data Collection and Use Practices In connection with its administration of the DukeCard program, Duke University collects data including the locations, dates, and times where DukeCards are used to access doors and buildings as well as when cards are used to “swipe” or “tap” in for attendance. This data is stored for 60 days before it is erased. Within that 60-day period, information may be used only in the following ways: Category 1 - Operational support Duke’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) may use card tracking information to troubleshoot problems with card access security equipment or problems with the ID cards themselves. The IT Security Office may access data as part of a cyber security investigation impacting Duke University or the Duke University Health System. Category 2 - Security and public safety Duke may be compelled to produce DukeCard access data in response to a subpoena or as otherwise required by law, as documented in Duke’s Acceptable Use Policy. The Duke Police Department may directly access data as part of a police investigation or public safety event impacting Duke University or the Duke University Health System. Category 3 - Space utilization or property issues (schools/departments) A complete and compelling case from a department head must be made for why the data is needed. Any data involving personally identifiable information requires EVP approval. Requests pertaining to property security must be submitted through the DUPD (Category 2). Category 4 – Service Improvements Category 5 – Student and Academic Affairs Student Affairs may directly obtain the door access data in the event of a student safety or health and wellness concern. The Office of Student Conduct in Student Affairs may directly obtain the card door access data in the event of a disciplinary matter after receiving appropriate authorization from the vice president for student affairs or his designee. The Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education in Trinity College and The Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering, or their designee, may request card swipe data in event that such data could inform the appropriateness of granting an academic exception/accommodation as requested by a student. Category 6 - Event attendance Access information for attendance to training sessions or other events may be provided to the organizers, in cases when there has been advance notification to attendees. Other usage The DukeCard office may also review other requests for access card information.  Requests are reviewed by the IT Security Office (ITSO) for appropriateness before being submitted to the Executive Vice President for approval. DukeCards are also used for financial transactions. Individuals may request an accounting of their transactions by visiting the DukeCard eAccounts Portal.  Financial transactions are kept on record for 7 years and are not provided to Duke departments or others without the express approval of the Executive Vice President or his/her designee. Data Request Process and Approvals The Office of Information Technology DukeCard Office is the data custodian responsible for Duke Card access data and for adherence with these standards. Any requests for access to the data should be directed to dukecard_data_requests@duke.edu and include the following information: Information requested (e.g. access date(s)/time(s), cardholder name, card number, Duke Unique ID number, etc.)
prompt: Who should receive the report, completion:  Business reason this information is needed and how it will be used Aggregate or individual data (details by cardholder or a summary of access in a given time period) Data access requires approval by Duke’s Executive Vice President (EVP).  All data access requests are received by the DukeCard office and sent to the CISO and CIO to begin the approval process. The EVP has delegated to the ITSO approval for certain data requests that are unambiguously within the narrow scope of the Data Collection Use and Practice. All other requests received by the CISO and CIO are review with the EVP.

The DHTS Senior Leadership Team has designated an unscheduled outage due to an expired SSL certificate as a "Never Event".  To ensure that SSL certificate owners are aware that their SSL certificates are expiring soon, DHTS has implemented an SSL certificate expiration alert process in ServiceNow. InCommon Comdo SSL certificates obtained via the ServiceNow Duke Health-SSL Certificate Request are automatically entered into ServiceNow for expiration alerting. If you have certificates from other Certificate Authorities such as DigiCert, GeoTrust, et al., from the DHE Authority or are using self-signed certificates, DHTS recommends that you submit a request to enter the certificate information into ServiceNow to take advantage of the expiration alert process and avoid an unscheduled outage due to an expired SSL certificate.  See KB0022720 for details. ServiceNow SSL Expiration Alert Process Details Alerts are sent/assigned as follows if the support information is in the ServiceNow SSL certificate record. Days Prior to Certificate Expiration Alert Type Sent/Assigned to 35, 25 and 15 Owned by, Managed by and Support Group Incident Support Group Important:  ServiceNow SSL certificate records are individual, unique records for each certificate. The ServiceNow email alerts and incidents will be created as listed above as long as the specific expiring certificate record is active in ServiceNow. You can avoid continued email alerts and creation of the incident by responding to the email alerts as follows: If the SSL certificate is still needed: Obtain, install, test and put a new SSL certificate into production when you receive the first email alert.
prompt: When you are sure that the new certificate is working properly, submit a request to revoke the old certificate via the Duke Health-SSL Certificate Request form.  You must do this a few days before 14 days prior to expiration date in order for the revoke to be issued and the certificate status updated in ServiceNow., completion:  It is very important that you ensure that the new certificate is working as designed before submitting the revoke request.  Once a certificate is revoked, it no longer works. If the SSL certificate is no longer needed: Submit a request to revoke the certificate via the Duke Health-SSL Certificate Request when you receive the first email alert or at minimum one week before 14 days prior to the expiration of the certificate. Detailed ServiceNow Alert Process Workflow The following URL contains demonstrations and instructions on web reporting: Under Reports, click “Quick Tips for Web Reporting” TIP: You can look for specific information within the guide.  Click CTRL + F and type the name of the report you are looking for more information about Use the Duke Health - SSL Certificate Request form, and choose the option "Revoke an existing SSL Certificate".

Students may access the student version of Windows by visiting http://dukeoit.onthehub.com. Once students order a personal download of Windows, they will have only thirty days to access the download and product key within their accounts.  We strongly recommend that students keep a backup copy of the download and also write down the product key in case it needs to be used later.  There is an extended access guarantee that can be purchased through the web store.  This is unnecessary to purchase, as OIT can help students retrieve their downloads and keys while enrolled, and the guarantee will not grant additional access after graduation since the store uses netID to authenticate.  We recommend that students never purchase this. OIT can help currently-enrolled students retrieve their downloads and keys after the 30 days are up, but students that have left Duke will no longer have netIDs and therefore will no longer be able to access the store.  OIT cannot provide student-licensed software to individuals that are no longer students at Duke. Students can order "hard copies" of Windows from the web store as well.  These are ordered directly from a 3rd-party distributor, and typically take about a month to arrive. The versions of windows offered through OIT are volume-activated products rather than retail products that come with product keys. Volume Activation is a product activation technology that was first introduced with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It is designed to allow volume license customers to automate the activation process in a way that is transparent to end users. Volume Activation applies to systems that are covered under a Volume Licensing program and is used strictly as a tool for activation and is in no way tied to license invoicing or billing. Volume Activation provides two different models for activating: Key Management Service (KMS) and Multiple Activation Key (MAK). KMS allows organizations to activate systems within their own network, while MAK activates systems on a one-time basis, using Microsoft’s hosted activation services.  All Duke users should activate windows using the KMS.  MAK activation is reserved for special instances where a Duke user cannot connect to a Duke network regularly for an extended period of time. KMS is the default method of activation for all Duke windows users,and should be used whenever possible and/or applicable.  Windows should activate automatically if connected to the Duke network or VPN.
prompt: How it works:, completion:  Once an installation of windows has completed, it will automatically search for the KMS server. Machines with DNS win.duke.edu, oit.duke.edu, and duke.edu should work with auto discovery. Other departments with third level DNS such as <dept>.duke.edu may need to add the entry for these users to be able to use auto discovery. You can verify automatic activation by selecting Start - Right Clicking Computer - Selecting Properties and then scrolling down. The Microsoft Key Management Server activates a client for a period of 180 days. Once a machine is activated, it will attempt to communicate with the same KMS every 7 days to renew it's activation; resetting its license counter back to 180 days. If the machine is unable to connect to the KMS, it will keep trying to do so silently every 2 hours until it is successful. If the machine hasn't been able to reestablish communication to the KMS after 180 days, the machine will become unlicensed and go into a 30 day grace period, notifying the user of this change. If the machine is not activated against the KMS after the 30 day grace period, it will enter a reduced functionality mode until it is able to connect to it's KMS or is changed to a MAK license key and activated. You will need to be on any Duke network or connected by VPN (virtual private network - see the section directly below). Run the command prompt as an administrator by selecting Start - All Programs - Accessories - then right clicking Command Prompt and selecting 'Run as administrator' (Windows Vista & 7) or On Windows 8, you can find the Command Prompt by hovering the mouse in the bottom-right of the screen, selecting search -> apps, and then either typing cmd or scrolling right under Windows System.  Right-click on command prompt and select Run as Administrator.Windows will prompt you for your permissions to run - Select continue At the Command Prompt Enter: "slmgr -skms kms-srv-01.oit.duke.edu" Wait for the pop-up box to indicate you have set your KMS Server. Enter: "slmgr -ato"' Wait for pop-up box indicating that you have activated your machine. Verify activation by selecting Start - Right Clicking Computer - Selecting Properties and then scrolling down Duke's agreement with Microsoft only permits the installation of these versions of Windows on faculty and staff members' home computers for work at home purposes.  The installation must be performed by your department's IT staff, or you must have written permission from them to install it on your home computer yourself for work purposes. Duke does not offer retail licenses of the Windows OS.  Individuals should seek out standard retail outlets to purchase. If you cannot easily communicate with the KMS, you may use or switch to the Multiple Activation Key (MAK) based license. MAK activates systems on a one-time basis, using Microsoft’s hosted activation services. The MAK-based license is best suited for machines that are not regularly connected to a Duke network (locally or with VPN), such as Duke-owned laptops primarily used off-site. While not highly restricted, we ask that if you connect to any Duke network on a regular basis that you use the KMS method of activation. If you are having difficulty activating via KMS, please try to troubleshoot the error before resorting to the MAK.  We have a limited number of MAK activations available.  You may request a special MAK by e-mailing site@duke.edu.  Requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by OIT.  Students graduating or leaving Duke may not request a MAK to keep KMS-activated copies of windows activated once they leave Duke. The KMS thinks that you are trying to install a volume-licensed version of Windows on a computer with no operating system present, which violates the license agreement.  The solution to this is to update the BIOS. This problem occurs if the KMS server does not find a valid Windows marker in the ACPI_SLIC table in the computer's BIOS program. Either the marker is corrupt or not present. Updating the BIOS should fix this. To update the BIOS, go to the computer manufacturer's website, most probably the driver download section, and download and install the latest update for the BIOS. The OIT Service desk should be able to help you with this. 919-684-2200. This error may occur if you are attempting to activate using the manual KMS instructions above, and you are not connected to a Duke network either locally or with the VPN client.  Please make sure you are connected to a Duke network and try again. To work around this issue, change the date and time to the current date and time.  We recommend that you use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) time source or the Active Directory directory service to synchronize the time between computers. Time is coordinated between the KMS host and the client computer in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This error occurs most commonly when the command prompt is not launched as an administrator.  You can do this by selecting Start - All Programs - Accessories - then right clicking Command Prompt and selecting 'Run as administrator' This error also may occur if you do not have the proper privileges on the computer or your network to activate windows.  Please make sure that you have the appropriate privileges on your computer and/or network (there may be group policies preventing you from activating, for example.  you could try putting it an a different OU and activating), and that you are right-clicking and launching the command line as an administrator. This error can occur if you are trying to use volume-licensing on a retail version of Windows or vice-versa.  For example, if you are trying to activate Windows 7 Home Premium with a MAK. If you cannot find the answer to your question here, or if your issue cannot be resolved with the solutions below, please contact the OIT Service Desk at (919) 684-2200 or email site@duke.edu.

prompt: How do I install from an ISO file without burning a disc? (Windows), completion:  I need to burn installation media but do not have a burner. An ISO file, often called an ISO image, is an electronic copy of an entire CD or DVD. The entire contents of a disc can be perfectly represented in a single ISO file. The most important feature of an ISO image is that it can be easily rendered or burned to a DVD or CD by using media authoring or disc burning software. It can also be opened using archival applications such as 7-Zip file manager. ISO burning is now typically a native feature of operating systems. Windows XP and Vista require additional software to handle ISO files, however.
prompt: How do I burn an installation disk from an ISO file using Windows 7?, completion:  Windows 7+ can burn an ISO image without any additional software. Download the ISO file to your computer Browse to it and right-click it Select "Burn Disc Image" (if this option is not available, select open with->Windows disc image burner) Insert a blank disc into your drive Click Burn ImgBurn is a free burning application that can be used to burn DVDs from ISO images. If you don't already have ImgBurn installed, click here to download it and follow the prompts to install it. Download the .ISO file After the file is downloaded, browse to it on your computer, right-click it, and select "Burn using ImgBurn" Put a blank disc in your CD/DVD drive. If you have multiple drives, select the appropriate drive from the drop-down menu under Destination Go to File-> write or click the image in the bottom left corner to burn the image to disk. The Mac operating system can handle ISOs in a similar manner in which it handles other compressed and imaged software (.zip, .dmg, etc.), and in most cases you can just double-click an ISO file and install directly from it. In some cases, such as downloaded bootable ISO files for the Windows operating system, or cases in which you are downloading installation media images for use on another computer, you will need to burn a DVD or CD. Instructions for burning an installation disk from an ISO file on a Mac: Newer versions of OS X (10.11+) Insert a blank disc Open the image you want to burn in the finder From the file menu, select burn from disc http://osxdaily.com/2015/11/22/burn-disc-images-os-x-finder/ Older versions of OS X: Insert a blank disc. Start Disk Utility (in Finder, click on Go > Utilities > Disk Utility In Disk Utlity, select File > Open Disk Image and the locate where the ISO was saved and select it In the list of volumes, you will now see an item representing the ISO file. Select it. Click the Burn button and follow the instructions. Use a CD for files up to 700 megabytes Use a regular DVD for files up to 4.7 gigabytes Use a dual-layer DVD for files up to 8.5 gigabytes (DL DVD) Use a Blu-ray disc for anything larger OIT does not distribute any images that can't fit on a dual-layer DVD.  Not all drives are capable of writing all types of media. Blank media can be purchased at the Duke Technology Center. ISO files are similar to .zip files in that they contain many separate files within. In some cases, the files can be extracted using archiving software such as 7-zip or WinRAR and then used to install software. This can't be done with Bootable ISO files, such as those used to install operating systems like Windows. Software requiring multiple disks for installation, such as SAS*. If you don't already have archiving software such as WinRAR, 7-zip, or WinZip, you'll need to download some. 7-zip is a free utility that can perform this task.  Then, after you have downloaded the ISO, browse to it on your computer, right-click it, and select the option to extract files. Once the files are extracted, you will see the contents of the ISO file in a folder, and you can click setup.exe or its equivalent to install the software. * With software requiring multiple discs to install, like SAS, when the installer asks you to insert the next disc, you can instead browse to the folder with the contents of the extracted ISO for that disc and continue the installation. You will need to purchase a capable drive or use someone else's. In many cases, an external disc burner can be hooked up to a computer via a USB port and then used to burn media. The OIT Service Desk at the Link in Perkins Library has this type of device, but they do not provide blank media.

Its use is detailed as follows: Clipping Video and Audio Clipping allows you to create a new segment of a larger video or audio file. It is available for all uploaded or camera captured video and audio files, but not for (previously recorded) live broadcasts. For example, you might want to clip a five minute portion of an hour long lecture, to share as an illustration of a particular concept. Or, you might want to create a clip of the middle 80 minutes of a 90 minutes class, so that the introductions and wrap-up are removed, leaving only the main lecture. You can access clipping from the settings pane for any video asset you own. Go to the video you want to clip, click the three-dots icon to the right of the asset title, then select "Settings." From the settings pane, click "Create Clip." The clip-creation pane shows the video timeline visually. You can click and drag the arrow bars on either end of the the timeline to select a video segment. Alternately, you can type in specific timecodes to select the video segment you want as your clip. Click the play button in the center of the panel to preview the contents of the clip you’re about to create.
prompt: When you create a new clip, it will not affect the original video. The new clip will be a separate video asset in the Media Library., completion:  The clip you just created will have the same title as the original asset, but with [CLIP] prepended. The clip will have fresh analytics and metadata. You'll be able to tag it, add captions, edit its title and description, and change the thumbnail: it is an entirely separate asset from the parent video. The "Create Clip" functionality is available for any asset your own, except live broadcasts. Multiple clips can be created from the same source video or audio file, and new clips can be created from clipped media.

The Contacts database or "Address Book" in Cvent is a listing of users who have received an invitation to or have registered for an event or who have been imported into the system. These users can belong to Groups in the Address Book. If your events are "open"  or if you are inviting your participants in other ways, you may not need a Contact Group. But if you are hosting private events using Invitation Lists, if you are repeatedly reaching out to the same group of users, or if you have a group of users that get special considerations during event registration, you may need a Contact Group created. Contact Groups are added to Cvent in two ways: They are added based on queries in the DADD system which are propagated to the Address Book. They are created manually by staff with appropriate permissions. The Cvent "Address Book" is shared among all Duke Cvent users (planners). For that reason, the permission to create or modify contacts or groups within it is limited and controlled. This is necessary to minimize duplication of user records and reduce "bad entries" such as blank names. Once these groups exists in the Address Book, event planners can modify registration settings so that registrants for the event are added to a designated contact group. Planners can also use contact groups to populate Invitation Lists. Configure an event to add registrants to a contact group Go to Website & Registration -> Registration -> Registration Settings. For each Registration Path, go to the Basic Settings tab and click the Edit button. Click Enable for the option Automatically add accepted invitees to contact group:. By the field Contact Group, click the field or the "..." button. Click Select by the group that should be populated. For the option When registrants cancel their registration:, indicate what should happen if a registrant cancels their registration. NOTE: the registrant will not be removed from the Address Book but this setting can remove them from the indicated group. Click the Save button to apply your changes. For information on how to use groups for your event, see KB0028461. If you requested a group be created manually, please be aware you cannot manually update the membership of the group from the Cvent Address Book at this time. You can contact dukecvent@duke.edu with the listing of users who should be added. *****THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRITTEN TO ASSIST EA-Business APPLICATIONS support team members***** To chat with a Service Desk representative, go to the IT Portal (https://duke.service-now.com/ess/), and click Chat with Service Desk.

Prior to the First Visit: Creating Orders Only Encounter You can order labs, imaging test, and research medications in advance, to be completed prior to a visit to the provider or coordinator, using an orders-only encounter.  With an orders-only encounter, if the patient does not keep his or her scheduled appointment, the signed order will be available whenever the patient arrives.  It allows the CRC to place orders on a patient without having to open up the patient's chart and create an unnecessary encounter.Here, you'll learn how to create encounters "on the fly" so that you can accomplish tasks that are not associated with a patient visit.  When using Maestro Care, you may need to place orders or create documentation when there is no appointment for a patient.  You may have seen the patient in the past and now have the need to write a progress note about the patient's progress.  Or, you may need to write orders, but there is not an appointment to work within.  To deal with these situations, you can create certain types of encounters.  For example, to add documentation to a patient's chart, you can create a documentation encounter.  To writer orders, you can create an orders only encounter.  Let's do that now.Click the Encounter button on the top toolbar: Type the patient's name or MRN and click Find Patient.  Select the appropriate patient and click Select. The Encounter Selection for Research window opens.  Click New to create a new encounter. For the type, click the magnifying glass and select Orders Only.  In the Provider field, enter the name of the Principal Investigator (PI) on your tent card.  Select the correct department and click Accept. An Orders only encounter is created and the Research Navigator opens.  You now have access to your order sets (Smart Sets) which will allow you to place the necessary orders on your patient in advance of their scheduled arrival.  This gives time for the orders to be second-signed (non licensed CRC) and ready when Harold arrives for his appointment.  We will now discuss how to enter and manage orders.Prior to the Visit: Using Smart Sets to Place Orders A Smart Set allows you to accomplish several tasks with just a few clicks on a single form, including ordering medications and procedures, documenting immunizations, entering diagnoses and levels of service, and providing disposition and follow up information. The SmartSets in Clinical Research are essentially order sets based on the individual protocol.  It allows a CRC to pick which orders the study will pay for, a given time based on the calendar, and established billing protocols.  It is a special type of order set which defines and establishes orders based on the medical protocols and patient timeline.Upon creating an orders only encounter, the Research Navigator should open automatically as the default.  Click SmartSets in the table of contents.  In the search box, type in the protocol number (PROXXXXX) and click Add or press enter.Make sure the selected box is checked and click on Open SmartSets.(If a pop-up window appears, simply select "continue".) From here we can open up and expand each section (by clicking the arrow for that section) and place a check mark in the box of the order you would like to order. You will notice several things: A purple square  indicates this is a future order The blue summary sentence when clicked, will allow you to modify details regarding the order.  It includes the expected and start dates when applicable. You also have the option to add an order not included on the protocol-driven SmartSet using the "add order" button.  If it is unrelated to the study, we will not link that order to the study.  For instance, if a patient stated he or she did not have their flu shot and wanted to receive it, an order for the vaccine could be placed via the "add order" button.  As long as we do not link it to the study, it will get routed to the proper billing party (i.e., insurance).

Several of these align with similar non research OIT infrastructure offerings.  There are 2 storage offerings as well as several compute offerings. Storage Storage offerings/prices are as follows: Storage Type Similar OIT Offering $/Gb/Yr Primary Use Research-Block SAN All Flash SAN attached Platinum $0.75 SAN attached storage to Compute VMs Research-NAS Disk with some Flash $0.12 General Use Research NAS Storage Datacommons All Disk NAS-Archive $0.08 Long Term Research NAS Storage Compute Unlike OIT Production VMWare environment that is regulated by memory, Research storage is limited and thus regulated by core.  For standard compute nodes, pricing for compute nodes is $112/core/year.  This $112 is for compute only and the storage is added at the above Research-Block rate. GPU In addition to standard compute nodes, OIT offers GPU compute capabilities.  Unlike standard compute nodes that are purchased in bulk, GPU capacity is purchased on an as needed basis.  Rates for GPU are as follows (GPU rates are an add on cost in addition to the cost of Compute, Storage, etc.).  Because GPUs are purchased as needed, we have a standard price that requires a 3 year commitment (to align with the 3 year lease of the equipment), or a higher rate that does not require the 3 year equipment. Current GPU Pricing with a 3 year commitment Commitment $/GPU/Year V100 3 Year $2,341 Titan XP $388 RTX $433 Current GPU Pricing without a 3 year commitment $3,511 $582 $649 Departments interested in one of the above OIT provided solutions, complete the OIT Storage Services request form. If your application requires a different configuration than these standard offerings, submit a general inquiry form to the OIT Storage Team to discuss alternatives.

Using your browser, go to https://duke.service-now.com/sp On March 4th 2019, OIT-CDSS will implement a security enhancement for remote desktop connections on all supported devices. This change will require users to connect to the VPN before being able to remote access (internally and externally) any Windows CDSS supported device. Groups Duke OIT provides pre-defined lists or "groups" of individuals at Duke, such as undergraduates, staff, or faculty. These lists can be used to populate the recipient lists or "groups" in Emma. Types of Groups These groups can be dynamic where a query searches the identity system for accounts that match the search criteria. If a member no longer meets the requirements (i.e. changes jobs or is no longer a student) these users are automatically removed from the group both at Duke and in Emma. There are also static groups which are maintained manually using Group Manager. If the group owner removes or adds a member, these changes are reflected at Duke and in Emma. NOTE: Emma users have the ability to add recipients to Emma directly without a Duke provided list. To do so, request a new subaccount from the system administrator. Group approvals Sub-accounts that will contain dynamic groups must get approval for use of the data in Emma. Users for these sub-accounts need to provide a case to the system administrator for why they need the groups added to their sub-account. If the group does not exist, the request will be sent to Duke OIT’s Identity Management team for processing. There are some terms that all common across services and platforms. For example, "email" is the transfer of electronic messages. But there are terms that either are unique to Emma or are defined differently in Emma. A/B/C Split TestingA test in which a list is split into three parts and sent different subject lines so that the sender can see which performs better. AudienceThe location for all recipients of emails including individuals, groups, and segments. BounceAn email message that doesn’t get delivered to a recipient's inbox. There are two types of bounces: soft bounce (the address is valid but the email cannot be delivered at this time) and hard bounce (the address does not exist or has been rejected). Hard bounces are deemed invalid and moved to Error status. They won't be emailed to again unless you reactivate them. BrandingStyle elements in a mailing such as colors, fonts, and images that associate a message with Duke. See URL for Duke Branding guidelines. CampaignThe location for all mailings including Draft, Scheduled, Sent, Automated, and Shared. CAN-SPAMThe U.S. law regulating commercial email -- requiring a truthful subject and from address, an opt-out link and a physical mailing address. ClicksWhen a user clicks a link within the message. If there multiple links and the messages is formatted correctly, each link is tracked. ContactsA listing of all individuals in your sub-account by email address. FooterThe area at the bottom of an email that contains information such as company or contact name and the sender's postal address. HTML MessagesEmail message which contains any type of formatting other than text, including any images, logos and colors. LayoutThe content area of a mailing, generally a mix of image placeholders and text boxes. MailingsIndividual mass email events regardless of status (draft, sent, scheduled). Open RateThe percentage of recipients who opened the message. OpensWhen a user views the message. If a user deletes a message without opening it, this does not count as an "open". PersonalizationPulling individual contact information into the body of a mailing automatically. (Example: Dear [% member:name_first default="first name" %],) Plaintext MessagesAn email message that includes only the text of an email’s content, excluding any type of formatting (images, font or text color). Pre-headerA few words about the email that appear above the header. Often, the pre-header provides a link to the online version of the email. Preference PanelContent below the footer of the mailing that often includes the email address the recipient used to subscribe to mailings, a manage preferences link, an opt-out link and signup link. PreviewThe ability to see how your mailing will appear on multiple devices such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones. ResponseThe section where you can find out the statistics of your mailing score, your opens and the link clicks for each mailing you send. SegmentsA saved query that separates a portion of your audience by criteria. For example, all contact emails that contain the word "gmail". Sub-accountThe division of Duke's Emma service into smaller groupings that are individually managed. TemplateAn item containing basic elements such as images, layout, and branding that is used to create consistent emailings. Templates can be shared across all sub-accounts or saved to individual sub-accounts. Test emailsMailings that are sent to verify content and layout. These include the word TEST in the subject and are not counted toward the responses data such as "clicks" and "opens". Test GroupAn audience group that contains up to 10 email addresses for the purpose of testing mailings before they're sent. The workstations are auto-launch and may or may not have a mouse and keyboard. ** Send Ticket to Device Support-FS DRH-DHTS if Call is from DRH and Device Support-FS DUH-DHTS if Call is from DUH** They will send ticket to Maestro Care Inpatient Team if needed for further assistance.

Using the Trash to Restore Files and Folders NOTE: Please go to this link for the latest documentation from Box.com on deleting and recovering files. Box features a Trash option, that allows you to recover files and folders that have been deleted. By default, all deleted items will be moved the the Trash location of your account and will be purged after 30 days. This purge period can be customized by administrators on Business and Enterprise accounts. Deleted items which have been moved to the Trash will still count against your total storage allocation. When items are deleted from a collaboration folder, both the owner and the user who deleted the item will be able to recover the items from the Trash. The item’s size will only be counted against the owner’s storage quota. Accessing The TrashTo access the Trash, click on your name (located in the top right corner) then select "Trash". You can get to this menu from any Box screen. Recovering Items On the Trash page you have the option to recover or empty the entire Trash folder, or specific items as needed. To empty or recover the entire folder, simply select “Delete All” or “Restore All” from the top of the page. Recovered files and folders will be restored to the location they were deleted from. To recover specific items from the trash, simply select the check box to the right of one or more items you want to recover and select the ‘Restore’ icon from the above the files. The following will be restored along with the file: Tags Comments Tasks Share state (whether the shared link is enabled or disabled) Collaborators The following will not be restored when recovering Expiration setting on shared links Expiration settings for deletion Admin SettingsAdmin-set expiration dates will be removed when the file is deleted, but when the file is recovered the Admin expiration dates will be reset and reapplied to the files as if they were a new upload. Business and Enterprise Administrators have the added options of disabling the Trash feature and customizing the purge duration. These options can be accessed through the "Admin Console" by clicking on the gear icon to the right of the search box at the top of the page, Select the "Content and Collaboration" tab and look in the "Trash" section. Additional Help For more help with Box.com please click KB0016658 Please click on KB0016669 for Box.com escalation procedures The following are instructions to use when requesting the development of scheduled file transfers associated with Duke Health using AutoMate, requesting a new or changed Managed File Transfer (MFT) account within GoAnywhere, or requesting File Transfer Assistance in regards to AutoMate.  Note that one-time file transfers will not be developed in AutoMate and should be completed using Box.com. File Transfer Workflow To initiate the development of a new file transfer, go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the File Transfer Workflow button, then select Request a New File Transfer Workflow.  Fill in all fields to describe the source and destination locations where the files are to be picked up from and delivered to, the file names, the applications generating and accepting the files, requested test and production dates, and how often AutoMate should check for a file.  Also specify whether you want a copy of the file sent to an archive location, and if emails should be sent after the files have been transferred. Once the online form is completed and submitted, a RITM will be created which will generate an approval task to the requestor's supervisor for approval. This auditing is required for requests that will result in a change.  After the supervisor completes the approval, a task is generated for AutoMate support staff who will initiate implementation of the request. Review the bullets below pertaining to tasks the requestor must initiate as part of completing the request form and implementing new file transfer requests. Files transferrred to/from Epic UNIX (epicdb) directories: refer to KB0016837 for instructions on how to request the creation of a UNIX directory on Epic.  If you need to request a new Epic UNIX directory, create 2 separate Requests in Service Now (1 for the new directory, 1 for the file transfer).  **If files are being transferred to/from pre-existing UNIX Epic directories, the request for creating a UNIX directory is not needed. Files transferred to/from non-Epic UNIX directories: coordinate with UNIX administrator to create and grant AutoMate a user account with read/write/delete access to the newly created directory Files transferred to/from outside vendor: If you need assistance completing the File Transfer Request, go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Application & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option for File Transfer Assistance -- this will ensure your questions will be addressed by the AutoMate support staff member on call in a timely manner. To modify/retire an existing file transfer, go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the File Transfer Workflow button, then select either Modify an Existing File Transfer Workflow or Retire an Existing File Transfer Workflow.   Fill in the description of what changes you are requesting, and fill in the name of the workflow that is to be changed.  See KB0024455 for details about how to find information on existing AutoMate workflows and tasks. Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account To create an MFT Account, note that a Duke Health DHE Account is required for access to GoAnywhere MFT to meet Duke Health Account Policy.  All Duke Health employees are automatically provisioned a DHE account.  Any application/vendor (Duke or non-Duke) that needs an MFT account that does not belong to a person will need to request a Service Account (see KB0016703).  Any non-Duke personnel will need to have a Duke Health employee request a Sponsored Account (see KB0013775) for each individual.  For Service Accounts, please answer "No" to the question "Will this account be used to authenticate user credentials?"  The remaining questions will not need to be answered. Any issues with passwords for the accounts are handled by the DHTS Service Desk (919-684-2243). Once a valid DHE account is obtained, go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account button, then select Create a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account.  Enter a detailed description of why MFT access is needed, how this MFT account will be used, what area is associated with the MFT account, etc.  Also enter the DHE account name to be given the MFT access, and the  project/application/vendor area that needs the account (an operational application from ServiceNow is preferred, if possible).  The 'Isilon folder to share' field is about to be removed and can be filled with 'N/A'. To update or delete an MFT Account, note that any issues with passwords for the accounts are handled by the DHTS Service Desk (919-684-2243).  To update/delete the MFT account (note that this only affects the MFT access for the DHE account; it does not affect the DHE account itself), go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account button, then select Update a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account or Delete a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account.  Enter a description of the request, such as what should be updated or why the account is no longer needed, and the MFT account name to be updated/deleted. Once the online form is completed and submitted, a RITM will be created which will generate an approval task to the requestor's supervisor for approval.  This auditing is required for requests that will result in a change.  After the supervisor completes the approval, a task is generated for AutoMate support staff who will initiate implementation of the request. File Transfer Assistance To request assistance in re-running a file transfer workflow, checking to see if files moved, requesting information about an existing file transfer workflow, or other assistance, go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the File Transfer Assistance button.  Fill in the description of what assistance you are requesting, and fill in the name of the workflow that is to be changed.  See KB0024455 for details about how to find information on existing AutoMate workflows and tasks. Once the online form is completed and submitted, a RITM will be created which will generate a task to AutoMate support staff who will initiate implementation of the request.  Requests for assistance come directly to the AutoMate support staff and should not result in a change.  If the outcome of a request for assistance is a change, the request will have to be re-entered to collect auditing information. From ServiceNow: From Duke Health IT Portal: All uploaded flyers will show in the "My Flyers" tab. Column "Displayed On" shows what feeds are displaying the flyer. Once the online form is completed and submitted, a RITM will be created which will generate an approval task to the requestor's supervisor for approval. This auditing is required for requests that will result in a change.  After the supervisor completes the approval, a task is generated for GoAnywhere support staff who will initiate implementation of the request. To update or delete an MFT Account (or have access re-enabled), note that any issues with passwords for the accounts are handled by the DHTS Service Desk (919-684-2243).  To update/delete the MFT account (note that this only affects the MFT access for the DHE account; it does not affect the DHE account itself), go to the Service Request Catalog from ServiceNow or from the Duke Health IT Portal (https://dhts.duke.edu – Get IT).  Under the 'Clinical Applications & Devices' section click on the 'Integration Services' menu and choose the File Transfer Request option.  Select the Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account button, then select Update a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account or Delete a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account.  To have MFT access re-enabled, choose Update a Managed File Transfer (MFT) Account.  Enter a description of the request, such as what should be updated or why the account is no longer needed, and the MFT account name to be updated/deleted.

Unlike OIT Production VMWare environment that is regulated by memory, Research storage is limited and thus regulated by core.  For standard compute nodes, pricing for compute nodes is $112/core/year. ***This $112 is for compute only and the storage cost needs to be added at the above Research-Block rate (For Example a 10 core VM with 100 Gb of Storage would be ($112/Core/Year10 cores) + ($0.75/Gb/Yr 100 Gb) = $1195/Yr) In addition to standard compute nodes, OIT offers GPU compute capabilities.  Unlike standard compute nodes that are purchased in bulk, GPU capacity is purchased on an as needed basis.  Because GPUs are purchased as needed, we have a standard price that requires a 3 year commitment (to align with the 3 year lease of the equipment), or a higher rate that does not require the 3 year equipment.  ***GPU rates are an add on cost in addition to the cost of Compute, Storage, etc. (For Example a typical GPU server with a 10 core VM, 50 Gb of Storage, and 1 RTX GPU would be ($112/Core/Year10 cores) + ($0.75/Gb/Yr 50 Gb) + ($433 per RTX GPU with 3 yr commitment/Yr)= $1590.50/Yr) Rates for GPUs are as follow: Departments interested in one of the above OIT provided solutions, complete the OIT Storage Services request form. If your application requires a different configuration than these standard offerings, submit a general inquiry form to the OIT Storage Team to discuss alternatives. If you have a list of individuals to whom you want to grant access, you will need to use Grouper. The easiest way to do this is to find the access plan that grants the access you want to give those people, and then add them to the members includes group for that plan. Select the group members includes. Click the "More actions" drop down button. Select "Import Members" from the drop down list. You have two methods of importing your list of users: Copy/past a list of member IDs (all Duke Unique ID's or NetID's) Import a file (text file) Copy/paste a list of member IDs Type or paste the IDs on your list into the text box, making sure to start a new line for each ID. You may enter either all DukeIDs – one per line or all NetIDs – one per line, depending on which form of ID you have.  When you are done, click the "Add Members" button.

Click on the Duke Card Office  folder under Browse folders in the left-hand navigation pane. To view everyone included in this access plan click on Members. A list of plan members will be displayed. The default view is to display All members (direct and indirect).  You can use the Filter for drop down list to display only direct or only indirect members. You will also see a search box to allow you to search large lists for specific group members.  You can search by name, unique ID, or Duke NetID. You may have times where you want to give access to more than one person at a time, or manage access using group lists for individual events or roles - e.g., contractors for a project, or visitors for a workshop. The easiest way to do this is to create groups in the access plans, and then add/remove members from those groups. So, the first step is to create a group. Open the access plan that you wish to create the group for. In the access plan, you'll see a folder called local. Double-click on that to open the folder. On the next screen, select Create new group from the More actions drop down list. Here is where you actually create the group. You need to give it a name and description that will make sense to you, and to others who might look at it. So in this example, I'm making a group for housekeepers who need access to the first and second floor of the Strickland building. The ID field is required, and it has to be different than the other groups in that folder. The easiest thing to do is to make the ID field the same as the group name. If you happen to pick an ID field that is already in use, Grouper will give you an error message. Now that you've created your group, you can add members to the group.  Click on the +Add members button to search for and add members to your group. Once you have added all the members to your plan, navigate back to your access plan folder. You can click on the folder in the breadcrumb navigation menu at the top of the screen. Select members includes. Click the +Add members button and enter the name of the group you created in the search field. Your group name will appear in the Member name or ID field.  Click Add. Return to members includes.  You will see your new group as a Direct member of members includes.

If you decide to use groups to manage manual lists of cardholders for your access plans, removing those cardholders is a slightly different process. You'll need to go into the local group that you created and remove them from the group membership, rather than removing them from members includes. Locate the access plan that the local group can be found in - in this case, the plan is called OIT-Demo_Plan. Click on the name of the group you want to edit.  In this example, I'm going to edit the group ATC Strickland Housekeepers. Check the box next to the name of the individual you want to remove, and then click Revoke membership from the Actions drop down menu. You will see a "success" message in the banner across the top of your screen when the individual has been successfully removed. The following items are monitored for all systems and have pre-set global parameters and thresholds for the alerts.

FIRST CALL The new treatment team role for First Call and associated changes to admission and perioperative transfer information are now active.  This update will help further ensure that you and our entire care team know who to contact regarding a patient or a question related to their care, and is another step in our commitment to safety and zero harm.
prompt: What you need to do?, completion:  Admitting services should ensure that their primary service patients are both assigned to their team’s list and have a First Call assigned. For patients admitted before activation of the new functionality, this can be done from the Treatment Team activity for an individual patient or using Assign Team and Assign Others when right clicking on patients in a list. Moving forward, providers will be required to specify Primary Team and First Call when placing admission or perioperative transfer information orders. The First Call role should be updated with handoffs of care. At the beginning of work, use Sign In activity or Assign Me to add yourself as First Call for those patients for whom you are the designated point of contact At the end of work, use Sign Out or Assign Others to change the First Call role to whoever you will be covering those patients if they have not updated the information If a patient is transferred from one service to another, update both the Primary Team and the First Call information using the Treatment Team activity The provider who is assigned as First Call will be highlighted on the header and on the treatment team overview widget.  A new patient list column can be added to easily view the First Call provider from a patient list.

Buy@Duke collects the contents of catalogs from suppliers and allows users to compare and select items from multiple vendors into one virtual shopping cart.Buy@Duke allows users to assign cost object codes to each item in their virtual cart. The customized system then routes the cart for approval: some units may choose to send all shopping carts to the department head, while others may permit certain shopping carts to be approved by staff within the unit.

prompt: How to request a Duke Medicine Tenable Security Center account?, completion:  Authentication is typically by NetID unless one needs to scan both Duke Medicine and Duke University environments. If one requires access to both Duke Medicine and Duke University environments of Tenable Security Center, the Duke Medicine environment will require a local Tenable Security Center account, where the ID will mimic the NetID with the characters “tns” appended To request access for Duke Medicine environment only, an Information System Administrator (ISA) may submit a ServiceNow ticket to group Security-Tools-DHTS To request access for Duke University environment only, an ISA may submit a ServiceNow ticket to Security-OIT To request access for both environments, an ISA may submit a ServiceNow ticket to Security-Tools-DHTS and state that access to both environments is required and include a list of IP addresses to be scanned
prompt: What is the password used to access the Tenable Security Center site?, completion:  The Tenable Security Center located at https://evm.duhs.duke.edu is the Duke Medicine Enterprise tool for managing vulnerabilities associated with IP addresses on the Duke Medicine Network. A Duke Medicine Tenable Security Center account will be required to login to the Tenable Security Center for reviewing vulnerability information associated with IP addresses and for managing and launching vulnerability scans. In addition, Duke University uses Tenable Security Center for managing vulnerabilities. The Duke University Tenable Security Center environment (user and vulnerability data) is isolated from the Duke Medicine Tenable Security Center environment and vice versa. IMPORTANT: Should you require access to the Tenable Security Center to manage vulnerabilities for both Duke Medicine and Duke University IP addresses; this will require two separate and distinct Tenable Security Center accounts. Duke Medicine - Authorization (Account) Requests & Password Information Duke Medicine Account reauthorization: For a Duke Medicine Tenable Security Center account is granted to active members of the DHTS-ISO ISOP README by submitting a request ticket to the DHTS Service Desk via the GET IT button at the Duke Health IT Portal at https://dhts.duke.edu including the information listed below. Please indicate that this ticket is to be routed to the Support@Duke Group Security-Tools-DHTS . Allow (3) business days for processing. First & Last Name Duke NetID: README Will manage vulnerabilities for Duke University IP addresses in addition to Duke Medicine IP addresses? (Yes/No). Authentication is by Duke NetID, unless the same user also manages vulnerabilities on Duke University IP addresses. This would require a second Tenable Security Center "local" account. The "local" account ID would be the NetID with the characters "tns" appended to the end. Problems with authentication should be forwarded to the DHTS Service Desk at 684-2243 for routing to the Security-EVM- DHTS. Allow (3) business days for processing. Password Information If you require a password reset for the Tenable Security Center user ID that ends in "tns" (which is a "local" account), contact the DHTS Service Desk at 919-684-2243 and request a ticket be submitted to Security-Tools-DHTS to reset your password. (This application is not patient care related and the DHTS EVM Team is only available 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.) If you have a single account and only manage Duke Medicine IP addresses then you have the ability to reset your NetID password at https://pwreset.oit.duke.edu/ or call the DHTS Service Desk at 919-684-2243, and request a NetID password reset. Caution: Please note that resetting your NetID password will change it for ALL systems and applications that use NetID authentication. Duke Medicine – New user introduction o The URL to access the console is https://evm.duhs.duke.edu, authenticate with your NetID/PW. o Please review your "ACL" asset lists which establish your "Defining Ranges" that allow you to view and scan for vulnerabilities based on the included IPs. Should you create new ACL asset lists, please share them with the "DukeMedicine" account and notify Service Now Group Security-Tools-DHTS that you have added the new ACL asset list. Adding or removing IPs or Rules to/from existing ACL asset lists will not require Security-Tools-DHTS notification. o The Tenable Security Center Training document contains information on how to use Tenable Security Center. The PowerPoint presentation will walk you through accessing and navigating within Tenable Security Center. o All “Critical”, “High”, and “Medium” vulnerabilities identified by vulnerability scans must be remediated. The system administrator or application owner is responsible for remediating vulnerabilities, when they are notified or become aware of them, in accordance with the Duke Medicine Enterprise Vulnerability Management Standard. o If you have any questions about the Tenable Security Center application or configuration within the tool, please submit a Service Now request and assign it to Security-Tools-DHTS. References: o EVM Home  o Enterprise Vulnerability Management Standard  o Tenable Security Center Training Document Duke University - Authorization and Password Information Authorization for a Duke University Tenable Center Account is granted by forwarding an e-mail request to security@duke.edu . An active Duke NetID is required. Provide in your email request the following information: The subnet(s) where your scan targets (Host IP addresses) reside. Authentication is by Duke NetID. Problems with authentication should be forwarded to security@duke.edu . Password Information If you have only managed Duke University IP addresses then you have the ability to reset your NetID password at https://pwreset.oit.duke.edu/ .
prompt: How to determine which Tenable Security Center to access: University, Duke Medicine, or Both?, completion:  For your inventory of IP assets, you can determine what subnets are managed by Duke University versus Duke Medicine with the following information. Duke University Public Subnets 152.3.x.x 67.159.64.0-67.159.127.255 Duke Medicine Public Subnets 152.16.x.x. RFC-1918 Private Addresses 10.0.0.0 172.16.0.0 192.168.0.0 The RFC-1918 IP address space can be tricky identifying since there is some overlap between Duke University and Duke Medicine. Unless otherwise known, noting what the DNS nameserver address(es) are for a given IP asset can provide a clue as to which entity manages the RFC-1918 address space in question. For Windows hosts, execute "ipconfig /all" and look under DNS Servers. For *NIX hosts execute "cat /etc/resolv.conf." If there is a reference to an IP address of 152.16.177.x or 10.32.0.5 for DNS Server(s) then the host is likely a Duke Medicine IP address, otherwise it is a Duke University IP address. Tenable Security Center Password Resets If a customer requires a password reset for the Tenable Security Center user ID that ends in "tns" (which is a "local" account) escalate a Support@Duke ticket to Security-Tools-DHTS for a password reset. (This application is not patient care related and the DHTS EVM Team is only available 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.) If the customer has a single account and only manages Duke Health OR Duke University IP addresses then the customer has the ability to reset their NetID password at https://pwreset.oit.duke.edu/ or assist them by resetting their NetID password. ***Please remind the customer resetting their NetID password will change it for all systems and applications that authenticate with NetID.*** KB001405 Enterprise Vulnerability Management (EVM) 2) To request access, go to the RAD Web site at https://radapps.duke.edu/rex 6) If you have problems logging in, call the Duke Health Service Desk at (919) 684-2243 and request help with your NetID and password.

Make sure the flag is not turned on. Smartsheet is approved via KB003896. Do not escalate a ticket to OIT or DHTS, follow instructions the KB. Cvent includes the ability to connect contacts to each other using the Related Contacts feature. Similar to the relationships feature in DADD, this functionality connects contacts in the address book. The benefits for configuring this for your events include the following: Registrants do not have to keep entering the same guest information for each event they attend. They can select from a list, making the registration process easier. Registrants can also add guests that are not on their list of related contacts. After an event, post-registration investigation and clean-up efforts are easier. If an existing contact registers for an event and brings guests that are related contacts in the address book, all of the information already collected about each is available to the event planner. It is important to "close the loop" with this feature. If you do not, someone already registered as a guest could complete a separate registration. Or a registrant could be added as someone else's guest. For example, Jane Doe could register and indicate John Doe as a guest. Meanwhile, John is unaware of Jane's actions and registers himself adding Jane as his guest. Follow these steps to enable the Related Contacts functionality. Go to Website & Registration -> Registration -> Registration Settings. Click the Guests tab (if this tab is missing, go to Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration and Edit to enable Guest Registration). Make sure the option Invitees can bring guests is set to Yes, then locate the Advanced Settings section and verify the following options are activated as indicated: Invitees must provide personal information about their guests during initial registration: set to Yes. Invitees can select guests from their related contacts: set to Yes. Add new guests to the: select Address Book and Invitee's related contacts. Accepted registrants can also be added as guests: set to No. Registrants' guests can also register on their own: set to No. Save changes, then select the Identification & Security tab. In the Privacy section, locate the option Pre-populate the information of registrants who arrive through a public weblink: and set this to Yes. This allows the related contacts option to be displayed once the registrant has entered their name and email address to identify themselves. Save changes. NOTE: If you have multiple Registration Paths, repeat the previous steps for each path. You may want to customize the message users will see if someone already registered is added as a guest (or guest as a registrant). Go to Website & Registration -> Website -> Language Management and search for "has already registered for this event and cannot be registered again". There are two results: The result with the Text ID value of vld_reg_0123 is the message that appears when someone adds a guest who is already registered for the event as a primary registrant. The result with the Text ID value of vld_reg_0124 is the message that appears when someone is acting as a primary registrant who is already registered as a guest. Click the pencil icon next to the Text ID field and in the Custom Text field, enter a new message to clarify the issue. For example: In vld_reg_0123, enter [&1] has already registered for this event and cannot be added as a guest. In vld_reg_0124, enter [&1] is already a guest for this event and cannot be registered again. Click the Save (or disk) icon to save changes for each Text ID.

You can export attendee information about your event from Cvent to DADD. However, in order for this information to be accurately reported, you will need to take specific steps during the setting up of your event and after it has completed. Event Planners: Event Setup
prompt: When an event is exported to DADD, all entities that registered, declined, cancelled, or were waitlisted will have an event activity record created on their DADD profile.  The Parties Involved Role will be Event Invitee, unless the registration type associated with the event registration is one of the five pre-defined roles that will be used to identify those who had a greater involvement in a particular event. Only the following registration types are recognized (anything else including "no registration type" is exported from Cvent as "Event Invitee"):, completion:  Speaker Host Organizer Volunteer Staff Follow these steps to configure your event and correctly categorize your attendees who have special roles: Under Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration, verify Registration Types is active. Under Event Details -> General -> Registration Types, add the registration types that will apply to your event (speaker, host, organizer, volunteer, staff). Enable only the ones relevant to your event. If registrants will not be able to select the Registration Type at the time of registration, you can still assign the correct role. Under Event Details -> General -> Event Configuration, make sure the Invitation List option is active. Under Promotion & Communication -> Email -> Invitation Lists, create an invitation list for each of the groups of individuals that have one of the roles listed above.  When creating the list, be sure to set the Assign registration type to list members who register option to Yes and select the appropriate registration type.  This is found in the Advanced Setting options when creating the invitation list. The individual must register with the name and email address on the invitation list in order to be assigned the correct registration type. You can also update the registration type for an individual: For registered users, go to Invitee Management -> Manage -> Invitees & Registrants and select the down arrow next to the registrant’s name. Choose the Switch Registration Type option and update the registrant’s registration type to the appropriate value. For individuals who are not registered, you can register for them by either of these methods: Under Invitee Management -> Quick Action -> Register Invitee, enter the name, email address and registration type of the individual. If there is an invitation list for the event, under Invitee Management -> Manage -> Invitees & Registrants, select the down arrow next to the registrant’s name and choose the Register option. Register the invitee with the appropriate registration type. Event Planners: Post-event Duplicate records It is very important once the event has completed that you identify any duplicate records for your event. A new record is created in Cvent when an individual registers for an event using a different email address or name than what was stored in the Address Book. In order to associate the event registration with the appropriate contact record, the event planner must locate and merge the duplicate records in the address book. For example, you know that all attendees of your event are Duke Alumni and each record should include the Entity ID or Duke Degree and Year information but some of your registrants are missing this information. This is a red flag that you have may have duplicate records. Search the Address Book for the registrant. Select the records that may be duplicates using the check marks, then go to the Actions button and select Merge. You can now review the records side-by-side. Check the following fields: Email address: if the address is the same, check the name fields to see if this a duplicate record or if this is two people who are sharing an email address. Source ID, Duke Unique ID, Entity ID: if any are identical, it is likely this is the same person. Be aware the Source ID should be the same as the Duke Unique ID but there are cases where it is the Entity ID. It is important to check all three fields. Lifetime FSB email address, Lifetime DAA email address, Business email address, Home email address: if the contact record was created or updated as part of the integration between Cvent and DADD, then other active email addresses associated with that individual will appear in these fields. Check these against the Cvent Email addresses for the records. Once you have identified duplicate records, you need to merge the them so all the relevant information will be preserved from both records. The two records will contain radio buttons where there is possible conflict. For example: the First name fields may contain "James" and "Jim". Use this process to merge the records and preserve the data. Select the Master record radio button by choosing the earliest creation date. Review the following fields and determine which information should be preserved by selecting the appropriate radio button. First name/Last name: If the record was created by self-registration, then this is the name the person used to register for the event, so it is likely how they will register in the future.  Because Cvent searches the address book to match registrations based on name and email address, it is best to select the first name and last name the person provided to us via registration so the likelihood of creating a duplicate record in the future is lessened. Email address: Choose the email address the registrant is most likely to register with next time, which is likely the email address they used this time. Source ID: The Source ID should match the Duke Unique ID.  If the Source ID equals the Entity ID, then it is important to select the blank value for Source ID. Duke Unique ID: Duke Unique ID should be 7 digits, with leading zeros as necessary. Entity ID: Entity ID should be 10 digits, with leading zeros as necessary. First name on badge/Last name on badge: If only one record has values for these fields, keep those values.  If both records have values, select the values for the most recent record, since this information was likely gathered as part of a current event registration. Duke Degree & Year: Select the values on the original record, if it matches what is in DADD (per formatting criteria). Class Year: If populated, this field should be the 4 digit year the degree was received.  If this is a Fuqua or Medical School alumni, the field should be the 4 digit year of the undergraduate degree, if received from Duke.  This can be spot-checked using the Duke Degree & Year field. Fuqua Class Year: This field should contain the 4-digit year the Fuqua degree was/will be received, if this is a Fuqua grad/student. MD Class Year: This field should contain the 4-digit year the Medical degree was/will be received, if a Medicine grad/student. Email addresses – lifetime, business, home: Like Duke Degree & Year, this information comes from DADD and those values should be selected for the merged record. Related Contacts: Related contacts should be pulled from the primary record (original record). If you are positive you are looking at the same individual, click the Merge button. NOTE: You will need to use your discretion based on your knowledge of the event and the invitation list (if it exists), as well as information available in DADD and via other means to determine if these records should be merged. If you are not sure, do not merge the records. Attendance records Event information in DADD will include information about registration as well as attendance. If an entity registers but does not attend, the activity record will be different than if they registered and attended an event.  Event attendance must be updated in Cvent in order for the information to be accurately reflected in DADD. If you use the OnArrival app, attendance information is automatically captured and synced back to Cvent. You can also use Cvent to mark an entity as a particpant During the event, go to Invitee Management -> Manage -> Invitees & Registrants and click the down arrow by the user's name. Select Mark as Event Participant. After the event, go to Invitee Management -> Assign -> Participation and select the participant(s) that attended the event by selecting the check box next to their name. Click the Update Participation button. Import your participant list by going to Invitee Management -> Assign -> Participation and clicking the Import Participants button. Follow the steps in the wizard. Exporting an Event to DADD Because of the verification required by an event planner after an event is completed to ensure the correct event roles are assigned to registrants, that all registrants that are entities in DADD are associated with an Address Book record that includes the entity ID, and that attendance has been recorded for the event, an event will not be exported to DADD until the event planner indicates the event is complete and ready to be exported.  Under Event Details -> General -> Event Information, in the Custom Fields tab, change the Ready to Export value to Yes. Only Completed or Cancelled Events will be exported, regardless of the value of the Ready to Export indicator.  Once the event’s status changes to Cancelled or Completed and the export indicator is set to Yes, the integration process will export the event information to DADD. Once an event is imported into DADD, it will not be re-imported by the integration process, regardless of any changes an event planner makes to the event status or the export indicator.  Any changes to event information after export will need to be made both in Cvent and in DADD manually. NOTE: All events hosted by/for Alumni should be exported to DADD once complete.  Other events may also be exported to DADD if the event attendance was largely targeted toward entities in DADD (donors, members, etc.). Not all of your OnBase Workflow windows display. You don't see all your work in OnBase. The screen is blank.

prompt: How to log into your PACE Azure VM:, completion:  To log in to your new PACE Azure VM, first download the .rdp file that is sent to you from the PACE Team and save it to your desktop or any location of your choice. Double-click that saved file to launch Microsoft Remote Desktop. You will be prompted to enter your NetID password. Additionally, you will receive a DUO push on your mobile device to complete multi-factor authentication. If you do not receive the DUO push notification, try opening the DUO app on your phone before double-clicking the .rdp file. Managing your PACE Azure VM: We wanted to share a few methods for you to conserve costs with this VM. You are only charged for the VM when it is up and running so when you are not using the machine you will want to make sure it is turned off. In order to do this, you will need to access the Azure Portal and log in with your Duke credentials. First enter <Your NetID>@duke.edu and it will take you to a Shibboleth page where you can log in as you do for other Duke systems. You will then select “Resource groups” and from this list you will select your resource group, where you should only see one listed. On the next screen, you will see 5 components of your VM that are listed in this resource group and you will select the item that has a “Type” listed as “Virtual machine”. This is typically the first item listed in the resource group. NOTE: The screenshots below show a different Azure instance, but the procedure will remain the same. From here, you can click the “Stop” option seen at the top and this will shut down your VM. Additionally, you can also configure for your VM to Auto-shutdown. You can do this by selecting the “Auto-shutdown” in the Operations sub-menu and set a time you know that you will not be working in the VM. If you have any questions regarding your PACE Azure VM, please reach out to the PACE Team at PACE_Info@duke.edu. For additional information, please contact the Duke Health service Desk at (919) 684-2243 and request a ticket be assigned to the Maestro Care Ambulatory-DHTS group or follow the Additional Resources section below to submit a Request.

Lists may be populated in a subaccount either by Group Manager or lists that you add yourself. A subaccount cannot have both. On the right, the Groups  in your subaccount are listed (groups provided by Group Manager will be here). You can select all the groups where the contact should be included.  Keep in mind that a user can belong to multiple groups and even if all groups are included in a mailing, the contact will receive only one copy of the message. For your first import, you will be reminded that the buying or renting of user lists is not permitted and you should not import addresses for people who have asked not to receive your emails. You can upload a file containing your contacts either by dragging the icon into the window or you can click Choose File. The import process recognizes files in supported formats of xls, xlsx, or csv. In the second dropdown menu, select Not in (as in "not in" any groups). Most of the time, you will not need to access the Audience section. The lists for your mailings are selected at the time the message is sent in the Choose recipients field. NOTE: Emma users have the ability to add recipients to Emma directly without a Duke provided list. To do so, request a new subaccount from the system administrator. Policy prohibits recipients to be added manually to subaccounts with dynamic or static lists provided by Group Manager. Sub-accounts that will contain dynamic groups must get approval for use of the data in Emma. Start the approval process by requesting a new list via the OIT Service Desk. Create a ticket that includes the name of the group needed and how it will be used. If the list isn’t already available, OIT Identity Management staff will guide the process for creating a new group. One feature that distinguishes Emma from other methods for distributing information, such as Sympa mailing lists, is that the Emma service has the ability to give you statistics about your recipients and how they interacted with your mailings. This also separates Emma from other methods for distributing information such as Sympa mailing lists. You have the option in Sympa of sending an announcement to all subscribers but you have no idea if your message was read, shared, or if any links in the email were accessed. Emma can tell you much more. Any team member in your Emma subaccount should be able to view the statistics for messages. It is also possible to set permissions for some team members so that campaign data is the only information they can see. Click analysis - Your email will be displayed with an overlay of where the recipients clicked. This can help you determine the best place for image, text, and link placement for future mailings. You can also display this information as a list by clicking List. This option will display all clicks ranked from most to least popular. NOTE: Emma’s service team has reported a bug with the Bounce data. What is displayed in the user interface may be incorrect. Verify the correct information in the report via Export. There is no date for this to be fixed. Select the Clicks tab to see a report of all recipients who clicked links in the message. You can also filter your report by clicking the down arrow by All Links to select a particular link in your email. For those with permissions that include Audience access, you can see the history and record of each recipient by clicking the down-arrow at the end of each line. NOTE: Messages sent to @duke.edu will interact with Proofpoint, the malicious link scrubber, when a link is clicked. Therefore, the clicks are erroneously high. The recipient may have only clicked the link once but the Proofpoint reviews are also counted for a total of 3 or more clicks. The Unique click values are the true clicks by the recipients. There are some terms that are common across services and platforms. For example, "email" is the transfer of electronic messages.

It is located at Maestro Care Sharepoint Site Knowledge base articles used to be imported into a WordPress site knowledge.oit.duke.edu. As part of that import, any image tag containing (src="/sys_attachment.do?sys_id...") code was programmatically modified to the absolute path (src="https://duke.service-now.com/sys_attachment.do?sys_id...") so that your browser knew where to find the images in Service Now. Now that we are importing the articles into the Drupal site oit.duke.edu, that programmatic modification is no longer taking place. This causes the images in the articles to be broken. To ensure that the images in your article can be rendered, you should update the src tags manually. To do this you will need to go to the article in Service-Now directly. Please reference https://duke.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0029815 for how to edit articles. In order to insert the absolute path for the images, you will have to access the source code of the article and look for the “img” tags. Access the source code of your article while editing the content, you will select the Source code button which looks like this ‘<>’ in the WYSIWIG. Locate the image tags which look like this: <img title="" src="/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=5cfe...". Add https://duke.service-now.com to the front of the links so they look like this: <img title="" src="https://duke.service-now.com/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=5cfe...".

This article is for Microsoft SharePoint 2013 and provides guidance for staff members who have been assigned the role of Site Owner for a SharePoint Site.
prompt: What is a SharePoint Site Owner?, completion:  A Site Owner is an authenticated DCRI user who has been assigned to the Site Owner Permissions Group on a SharePoint Site Collection. The Site Owner Permissions Group grants Full Control permissions to its members, allowing them to make fundamental changes including creating new Apps (such as Document Libraries and Announcements Lists), editing Web Pages, adding App Parts, and creating Public Views. The Site Owner is also responsible for user access, content management, and site usability.
prompt: What does a Site Owner do?, completion:  Site Owners of a DCRI SharePoint Site are expected to manage that site. They determine what appears on the site’s home page, how the site is organized, and what public views are available in the site’s Lists and Libraries. Site Owners may need to complete many of the following tasks. Maintain Your Site Create new Pages, Apps or Sub-Sites, to support your group’s expanding activities. Ensure that the site is easily navigable. TIP: Regularly pretend you are a visitor exploring your site for the first time, and then add or edit navigational elements where needed. Display contents in a way users can quickly find what they need. This may require creating new Public Views, relocating elements, or editing the Quick Launch. Ensure that key information is not buried within content-heavy pages or overpowered by pictures. Respond quickly to requests to add additional views, fix broken links, and make changes to App Part views. Be bold. If introducing a graphic, video, or other multimedia element will help address the goals of your site, try it out. If something does not work, you can simply remove or relocate it. Ensure that Site Members are uploading files to the appropriate library, and periodically check to make sure they are using metadata appropriately. Monitor Discussion Groups to help keep contributors on topic and address out-of-control situations. Control User Access Add and remove users in the Permissions Groups on your site. Periodically clean out members of these groups as people leave the DCRI, transfer, or take on different responsibilities. Where necessary, assign a specific Permissions Group to a specific element. Create new Permissions Groups to manage access to new tools or secure locations.
prompt: When necessary, change the access level for a Permission Group to a specific element, such as enabling Site Visitors to enter comments into a certain Discussion Board., completion:  Respond to changing access requirements. For example, grant temporary permission to a user by giving them direct access, or create a permissions group to manage access to a secure library from (Settings) > on the menu click Site Settings > under Users and Permissions click Site Permissions. Customize Site Appearance and Operation Replace your Quick Launch with a Tree View for a Windows Explorer style browsing experience in (Settings) > on the menu click Site Settings > under Look and Feel click Tree View. Add important links to your Quick Launch from (Settings) > on the menu click Site Settings > under Look and Feel click Navigation. Specify operating details, such as choosing a 12-hour or 24-hour clock, or changing to a different time zone from (Settings) > on the menu click Site Settings > under Site Administration click Regional Settings. Communicate with Site Visitors and Members Site Owners will receive important system information such as planned outages, changes to the environment, and new best practices. It is important that you pass pertinent information to your Site Members. If you make a fundamental change to your site, notify your Members and Visitors (and post this information where it can be easily found). For example, if you create a new Library tell your users how to find it and how they should use it. Your site’s contributors and readers will look to you for information. Site Members will ask for guidance on how to upload, edit, and delete content on the site. In some groups, you may be called on to set and arbitrate style decisions (such as word choice, placement, or color). Encourage your site users to proactively remove outdated or duplicate information from Lists and Libraries. Use description fields in your Lists, Libraries, and sub-sites (description opens with button), to describe their purpose and appropriate use. Run Reports As a Site Owner, you can run reports on the popularity of your site and its contents at (Settings) > on the menu click Site Settings > under Site Administration click Popularity Trends. The SharePoint Site Collection Revealed As a Site Owner, it is helpful to have a deeper understanding of the structure of a SharePoint Site Collection. All elements within a Site Collection are organized into two different areas: Site Contents and Settings. Site Contents Site contents include Apps, Pages, Files, List Items, and Sub- Sites (collections of content within a site). Site contents are assigned a web address (URL, short for universal resource locator) when created. URLs are added to site navigation (Top Navigation or Quick Launch), to Views, and to pages to make content available to site users. A tool called Site Contents provides a convenient place for users to access all of a site’s content. To open Site Contents, on the Ribbon, select (Settings) > on the menu click Site Contents. Many SharePoint sites will also have a link to Site Contents in the Quick Launch. The Site Contents page opens (above), and users can click on an App to access the content therein, or click on a Sub-Site to browse to that Sub-Site’s home page. With Full Control permission, Site Owners can create Apps and Sub-Sites, and make settings changes to them. Settings There are three types of Settings on a SharePoint site: Site Settings, App Settings, and App\Web Part Settings. Site Settings include things like Permissions, Regional Settings (Time Zone), Title, and Navigation. To access the Site Settings for a site, on the Ribbon, select (Settings) > on the menu click Site settings. The Site Settings list (above) appears. Site Settings are disassociated from content to make them scalable. For example, although the Site Member Permissions Group typically has Contribute Permissions, you can designate a different Permissions Level, such as Read, for that group with respect to other content such as a Library or Sub-Site. In the following example members of the Site Member group have been given Read permission to a Sub-Site in the site collection, but they retain Contribute permission everywhere else. Take navigation as another example. Since navigation elements, such as the Quick Launch, are controlled by a site setting, you add a new link to the Quick Launch by changing a Navigation setting. You do not have to add the new link manually to every App and on every page. App Settings are accessible from your Library and List toolbars. From either toolbar look in the Settings group, and then click on the Library Settings, or List Settings, icon. App Settings include things like List Name, Versioning, Permissions, Columns, and Views. App Part and Web Part Settings can be opened only while a page is in Edit Mode. Click the Triangle Icon in the App\ Web Part header and select Edit Web Part to launch the settings tool. These settings allow you to change App\Web Part title, height and width, views, and in some cases indicate from where a Web Part gets its content. You Are Not Alone You are not expected to fulfill all of your responsibilities alone. There are a variety of resources you can turn to for help. For advice, directly contact other Site Owners, a SharePoint Trainer, or the DCRI Service Desk with your questions. Get yourself a back-up. Every site should have at least two site owners to cover one-another during time off from work, and to share the load. Need help organizing your site, creating a new tool, migrating documents from your K: or T: drive, or getting your App Part settings just right? Contact Technology Training and ask for a coaching session. Lean on your site users for help in completing tasks in a timely manner. Encourage your Site Visitors to provide feedback on views and to notify you when they find dead links. Enlist your Site Members to help keep lists and libraries clean by removing old\outdated content. Remember, thousands of people use SharePoint every day. If you want to achieve something but are not sure how it is done, Google it. Chances are good that someone has already done it and has posted their process. For Further Learning SharePoint has an incredible amount of features, but it is scalable. On the one hand in just three hours you can learn to grant access to DCRI users, create web pages, and even create useful tools to help your team be more efficient. On the other hand as long as you use SharePoint you will discover new tools, and find better ways to build sites and pages.

For example, adding yourself to a patient's treatment team causes the patient to appear on the My Patients list. If a research patient is admitted to the hospital, you will be notified via the InBasket. You will then have the option of adding him or her to your patient list and becoming an active treatment team member. From the schedule tab, find the patient and right click.  Select Open Care Teams. Select Add Me. Complete the care team Relationship field with the yellow yield sign. Click Accept and then Close. To end your assignment, right click your patient's name on the schedule and select Open Care Teams.  Find your name and select End and then Close.

Assigned ticket to: EA-Business Apps As of May 25, 2019, we have moved away from the standard "Small/Medium/Large/X-Large" model to one that is more flexible. The rates were calculated using the same base numbers so VMs should be priced very similar as the previous model.  If you have any questions or concerns with the new pricing, please email Eric Johnson (ej36@duke.edu). The new model for the cost of each production VM is as follows (All rates below are listed annually): Base VM Each VM will have a base rate of $19.23 per VM Memory will have a rate of $15.50 per Gb In addition to the optional levels of TSM backups, we have Veeam VM based backups that is included with all VMs as part of the base rate.  These Veeam VM based backups provide a full copy of each VM that is snapped every other day.   The Veeam backup is intended only for disaster and/or complete corruption of a VM recoveries.  To be able to recover individual files or partial VM data recoveries, TSM is the solution as Veeam does not have that level of capabilities. No Storage or TSM backups are included with the standard rate.  Previously there was a 25 Gb default built into the pricing, but due to different operating systems having different needs we do not have any storage included in the base configuration. Storage for each type is as follows (all in $/Gb/Yr) No additional charge *pricing updated 5/25/19 Example Cost of a VM So as an example a VM with 2 Gb of memory with 25 Gb of Silver storage with onsite backups would cost: ($19.23 base rate/Yr)  + (2 * $15.50 $/Gb/Yr) + (25 * 0.59 $/Gb Silver with onsite/Yr) = $64.98/yr Comparing this to the previous model: This would have been a standard Silver Medium VM with no Sys Admin which had a cost of $65.00

This steering committee is responsible for coordinating Maestro Care clinical criteria definition (i.e., clinical content) process management to: Chair (2018, 2019):   Dr. Genie McPeek Basinger (formerly Hinz) Resources (SP = SharePoint website files; E = in Epic; Box = in Box) Content Review Process Overview Requests for new clinical content should be submitted via ServiceNow. The steering committee will coordinate an environment assessment to determine if the content already exists, or if similar content may be revised. The clinical content committee staff will coordinate appropriate stakeholder reviews and participation and will work with the submitter to manage their request. In general, order sets, smart sets, and standalone panels are reviewed by an informatics liaison (e.g., a Provider Champion) reaching out to an appropriate operational SME. As soon as the review is complete, GetSmart metadata are updated accordingly (e.g., Champion communicates to Clay) so that review dates of the entire library remain up to date, to allow for a more efficient review process overall (e.g., to keep focus on the next reviews needed). If the content needs a build update, a ticket is entered with the prefix "CCR" to indicate the request originated from Clinical Content Review and thus to assist the MC team in classifying and prioritizing. Then, during build, the builder ideally confirms &/or updates the GetSmart metadata as part of the build (e.g., updating the Last Review date if the requester does a subsequent review to validate the build).

Application: RelayHealth IT Service: EHR Pharmacy Service Offering: EHR Ambulatory Pharmacy Offering Windows Server Naming Standard *Note: Names can use a maximum of 15 characters, including hyphens. Registered Prefix: This is a short acronym which identifies the department that this server is being request for. Project Abbreviation (3-4 characters): This helps identify the project that this server is associated with. Environment and Role (3-6 characters): This identifier helps indicate the types of services being run on this server and how critical they are. Number (1-3 Numbers): This identifies which instance or iteration this system is within this project. All prefixes for Windows servers must be registered on the Department Registry Page. This prefix should closely match the acronym corresponding to your department. (*Note: larger projects with multiple servers may require a new prefix). Duke University Office of Information Technology: OIT Systems Support and Infrastructure: SSI This is a 3-4 character abbreviation chosen by the administrator or service owner ( which is typically the individual who is requesting this server ) that should uniquely identify a project or logical group of servers. It's highly recommend to make this abbreviation easy to pronounce while also being descriptive. For instance: For a project called Git Package Builder Tester Service, gitbldr is a lot better than gpbts. SSI Production My Package Hosting Service: ssi-pkg-pap1 OIT Development Inscribe Konnect Compliance: oit-scribe-dap1 The last section of the name will include an environment, role abbreviation, and number.

D: Development Server - This service will be used for developing services that may later be moved into testing or production. P: Production Server - This server will be running production level services and will therefore require high availability and stability. SB: Sandbox Server - This server is not indented to live long and will be used to primarily explorer proof of concept ideas. Role: The role abbreviation is a 2 character code which helps classify the types of services that this server will be hosting. Note - Sometimes server roles will overlap and in that instance it's best to choose a role that best coresponds to this server's function. DB: Database Server - This server's primary job will be to host a database of some sort such as Microsoft SQL Server. AP: Application Server - This server's primary job will be to host a backend application that does something like batch file conversion.

Maestro Care Ambulatory Left Without Being Seen Workflow In the event that a patient encounter is opened and documentation begins on the encounter (e.g. vitals are taken, patient history documentation is noted, etc.), and then the patient terminates the appointment, or leaves without being seen by the provider, there is a Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) SmartSet that will allow the physician to close out the encounter by automatically inserting the required encounter closing elements (diagnosis, progress note, level of service). The nurse could pull in the Smartset for the physician to prep the encounter. Left without being seen (LWBS) SmartSet: Sections of the SmartSet are editable, especially the documentation portion, if additional notations are needed. If other services were performed by the nurse, the nurse should select the applicable charges from their Charging Preference list and associate an appropriate diagnosis with that procedure (example: Spirometry). No other action is required to close the encounter for NON-Hospital Based Clinics. The appropriate no charge visit codes will drop along with the procedure charge if applicable (example: Spirometry). Hospital Based Clinics (HBC) In addition to the SmartSet, under the Charge Capture section, the nurse should select the HC LWOBS/PROC/RSRCH ONLY VISIT (99900001) as their Facility Level Charge. Same rule applies if other applicable charges are added to the encounter (example: Spirometry).

Toll Free Service (Inbound)Domestic (TFS) and International Toll Free Service (ITFS or ITFN) is provisioned through one of OIT’s service providers, then “pointed” to a local Duke (10) digit phone number where calls are received. If you require a new Duke telephone number to be assigned, OIT will need to know the physical phone(s) to program this on. This phone number can appear and ring on any Cisco VoIP phone that has a vacant programmable line appearance button. If voice mail is required, OIT will create a new voice mailbox on the local Duke phone number that you requested the TFN to ring to. Installing a new Duke phone number, will require that you include a valid Duke cost center to charge the monthly line expense to. Departments are also charged a usage fee based on "minutes of use" (MOU). This is the per minute rate the vendor charges OIT.

A: Please have your guest log in here: DukeHub (Student Proxy) Tool for collaboration: Not for file storage and enormous file sharing solutions. There will be a limit of 10 M per file, and a soft quota of 1 GB per space. The 1 GB quota is not enforced by the server, but will be checked from time to time by Systems-OIT-UNIX.Accounts are self provisioning: Anyone with a NetID and password can login, and if an account does not exist it is created when they first log in without them knowing it. This does mean that if someone is trying to add someone to their space, that person needs to already have an account.ONLY NetID users can create accounts: If people wish, they can set their space to be viewable by anonymous, which means anyone can go look at it without logging in. However these people cannot edit the wiki. There is an option to turn on anonymous commenting, which would allow anonymous viewers to make comments on pages. This is about as close as you can come right now to letting a non-netid user work with you on a project. Possibly in the future this will change, but not in phase 1. Commenting is secured by character recognition to attempt to prevent spam. To request new spaces: *see Student Group Requests and Faculty Request for Courses below on formatting and procedure There is a form inside the wiki. Being inside the wiki prevents people who don't have accounts from requesting spaces. The Service Desk will receive these requests through Support@Duke, and it will be our job to verify it is a legitimate request, and create the space. Spaces should only be for official courses, departments, and student organizations. If faculty/staff member wants a space for a group or such, verify it sounds like a real group in some way, and create it for them.  Systems-UNIX-OIT is not particularly worried about us policing staff/faculty requests as long as it's for a group and not a single user, and does not get abused. If it does this may change. For student groups, we DO need to verify they are a REAL group. This will be done in conjunction with OSAF, and OSAF will be added as an administrator on all student organization spaces created. This will solve our current problem in AFS such as when presidents/webmasters of clubs graduate and leave. OSAF will be able to identify who left, and give permissions to the correct new students for that group. Do not create a student group space based only on their word, it must be verified as an official group. Permission:
prompt: Can still be done by individual user or group. Space Admins (people who own/administrate a space) can now manage/create their own groups. This means we won't have to add/remove people from groups all the time for people anymore. There are lots of new links and tools for creating and managing groups, please get familiar with them by exploring wiki-test.oit.duke.edu. Problems for individual users go through remedy to OIT-SSI-T4-SysInfra-UNIX, completion:  Student Group Requests 1) Student groups will request DukeWiki spaces via the standard OIT online form. 2) The Service Desk will validate that a student group is Duke-recognized using the OSAF web page: http://osaf.studentaffairs.duke.edu/studentorgs/stuorgs/index.html 3) The Service Desk will create the space, adding both the requesting student and a new group ("osaf-admins") as space administrators. 4) The Service Desk will email OSAF a notification about the space creation: leslie.grinage@duke.edu and clv4@duke.edu 5) The requesting student and/or OSAF will be able to import content into this new space, if they desire, using an XML template.  The decision as to whether to import this content lies in the hands of OSAF (should they make it a standard workflow) or the student requester/student group (via documentation/training.) 6) To join a group, students will first have to self-provision for DukeWiki.  Then, the student space admin (or OSAF) can add them as a member, via either NetID or searching for the student. 7) Space expiration notices will be sent to all space admins, which will include the osaf-admins group.  This will help guard against deletion of inactive spaces.  OSAF and/or the student lead can choose to export the space if desired at that point. Faculty Requests For Courses If a faculty member requests a space it must be named after the course. Use the DukeHub listing as a general guide line for naming convention. So for Space Name you can use the Course Name in DukeHub. For Space Key you can use the Course ID in DukeHub. Remember, the Space Key also ends up being part of the URL for the web page. Also, you may want to drop the term if they plan to use the space successively. General Naming Guidelines https://wiki.duke.edu/display/dwh/Space+Naming+Guidelines Reporting incidents The OIT Service  is the primary contact for customers regarding DukeWiki. Functional Issues If the Service Desk is unable to resolve an issue, it will escalate a Support@Duke ticket to Systems-UNIX-OIT for further assistance. Depending on the issue, that group will either send the ticket back to the Service Desk containing information that will allow the Service Desk or the customer to resolve the issue, or contact the customer directly to resolve the issue.  A walkthrough for SD Analysts to set up a wiki space can be found here Technical Issues If DukeWiki is unavailable, the OIT Service Desk will send an urgent ticket to the SOC, following established escalation procedures. Turn this report in with the your deposit just as you would like the cash drawer.  The cash drawer is only good from the time it was created forward.  Any money collected before the cash drawer was created will be on this report only.

This could be because environmental reasons, severe weather, damage to the pager, or locations with reduced signal strength.
prompt: What should I do if I receive a garbled page?, completion:  After validating that there are no immediate patient needs or risks to safety, please contact the Operators* so they can look up the page message that was garbled and retest your pager to validate the pager is still able to decrypt messages successfully.

Application: Preventice Service Offering: Cardiology Apps Offering The following items are monitored for all systems and have pre-set global parameters and thresholds for the alerts. These are periodically updated in conjunction with the DHTS Hosting Team.  Please reference https://intranet.dh.duke.edu/dhts/cto/em/Shared%20Documents/DHTS-Standard_Monitoring_and_Notification.xlsx?Web=1  or KB0030854 for what is currently part of the hosting global standards (note this article is only available for internal, IT Support Staff). Within 15 minutes of the event occurring, an alert is logged in ServiceNow/Support@Duke via Netcool (see below) as an incident and the incident is assigned to Operations-DHTS.  DHTS Operations staff are available 24 x 7 to triage and attempt to resolve alerts using instructions provided by the application owner.  If they can resolve the issue, they will close the incident.  If they cannot resolve the issue, they will escalate the ticket to the Support@Duke group designated by the application owner. NOTE: This option only works if you do not have any personal folders. For example, if you only had a My Patients and a My Unit folder before and now only have a My Unit folder, this step will work for you. However, if you had a My Patients, My Unit, and a personal folder (ie. Joe’s Patients), this step will not work for you. Steps To Complete If You Do Not Have Any Personal My List Folders: 1.  If you still have a one of the two folders (My Patients or My List) remaining, right-click on the folder, and choose Delete My List. Click Delete in the Patient Lists box that appears.             2.  Log out of Maestro Care and log back in. 3.  Your My Lists folders (My Patients and My Unit) will be restored. Steps To Complete If You Have Personal My List Folders: If you have other folders within your My Lists section, you will have to create a new folder. 1.  Click the little triangle next to the Edit List button and select Create My List b. A New List screen appears. In the Name: field, type My Patients (or My Unit) and then click Copy.                      c. A Choose Columns screen appears. In the Use a Template field scroll and find the template appropriate to the user and list, and click Accept.  For example: f. Under Available Lists, click System Lists --> Patient Lists to see all available patient lists. You can add one of these system lists one of two ways - Option 1 - a. Click-and-drag All My Patients to My Patients or Login Department to My Unit. When you see a plus sign below the mouse arrow, release the click. Option 2 - a.  Right-click on All My Patients (or Login Department) --> click Send To --> select My Patients (or My Unit) After completing the steps for Option 1 or 2, the system list is viewable in the My Patients (or My Unit) list My Lists can show system lists which are dynamically updated lists managed by Epic (multiple stick figure icon) AND contain patients manually added to them by the end user (one stick figure icon). To see what is included in this folder, click the triangle to open it. A single stick figure icon means the patient was manually added. If that patient should no longer be on the list, right-click on the patient and choose Remove Patient. Click Remove when prompted. *** For either scenario, the clinician will need to contact the owner of the shared list to update the access provided.  As an owner of the list, there should ALWAYS be more than one person who has complete access to the list to add/ remove users.  This will eliminate list issues if the owner leaves the system, and no one can update the list after the owner is gone. *** *** If the owner is no longer at DUHS, a new list will need to be created and shared with other users.  DHTS cannot change the owner of a Shared List from one person to another *** The CoreResearch@Duke (LabVantage) WebI Universe User Guide is attached to this article.

Logging in Once accepted into the pilot for Emma at Duke, bookmark https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/emma-emailing for your login. You must first be given access to login by the OIT Service team. Contact the Service Desk if you have problems. Recipient lists As part of your onboarding process, the OIT Service team will walk you through a design process to determine how your email recipient lists will be generated. There are two types of Emma accounts based on the type of recipients you will be mailing. Automatically populated lists are maintained and generated by the Duke OIT Identity Management team in a curated subaccount. Lists are updated daily from PeopleSoft and SAP records. Access to lists provided by Duke are restricted. The owners of the data will grant access based on content and number of sends to the audience. Users may not export the data from Emma and store it outside of Emma. Automated lists are synced once per day, overnight. Browse existing lists or request a new list at https://groups.oit.duke.edu/groupmanager/. NOTE: Recipients may not be added directly in Emma if the subaccount has an automated sync via Grouper. Self-managed lists are maintained by the user without engagement by the Duke OIT. The lists can be gathered from sources within Duke or elsewhere. Email addresses external to Duke are permitted in a self-managed subaccount only, but total number permitted may be limited. A separate subaccount is required from an automatically populated list. No personal health information can be sent through Emma.
prompt: What to look out for?, completion:  With any new system there are some known issues in process, here are the ones we’re working on with Emma: Click-rate data for Duke recipients is erroneously inflated. Because Duke’s email delivery team is taking great care to deliver only the messages we want to receive and not the junk or spam, our email messages are routed through a service called Proofpoint. This routing is counted by Emma the same as a click by the user. Therefore, one click by the user will be reported as 3-4 clicks by Emma. Bounce data that displays in the Emma reporting user interface is incorrect. Emma’s team has confirmed the bug and is working to resolve it, but doesn’t have a roadmap for it. For now, you CAN get correct data from Emma by reviewing the data from an export. Duke recipients who have set their email to forward beyond the address Emma is sending to, such as Gmail, will not receive the message at the forwarded address. Emma is sending to the preferred email address set by the recipient at https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/account-self-service. The default is netid@duke.edu. Getting help Contact the OIT Service Desk with your questions about Emma. Our support hours for Emma, specifically, are: Full Support – 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. University business hoursExtended Support – 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST University business hoursLimited Support – outside of these hours NOTE: Bulk emailing to individuals at Duke is subject to the group email policy.

prompt: How can I move the button to the message surface (ribbon) in OWA?, completion:  Mobile Outlook for Android Outlook for iPhone/iOS Users of Duke's Exchange Online system can report suspicious emails to OIT and the Duke IT Security Offices with one click of a button.  This is the Phish Alarm button which is part of our Proofpoint mail system.  The button is part of the Proofpoint service (https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/proofpoint), already in use at Duke for protecting accounts against malicious links and attachments in emails. The IT Security Offices and OIT are encouraging users to use the new “Phish Alarm” button to report any suspicious email instead of submitting a ticket or emailing the security@duke.edu list. After clicking the button and confirming you wish to report the message, Phish Alarm will send a copy of the email (including email header and content) to Proofpoint's Phish Alarm Analyzer and the Duke Security Offices for review. Any message determined to be a phish will be removed from the your mailbox.  The system will also remove any copies of this message you have forwarded to others, and if the message was sent to a distribution list it will be removed from the mailbox of all members of the recipient group. The new “Phish Alarm” button is available in all Outlook email clients (Windows, Mac, Web, Android and iPhone).  The button looks generally like one of these icons (it may not include the words PhishAlarm).  Mobile devices do not use Outlook as their native client and therefore are not able to support the PhishAlarm button. Outlook can be installed through the Apple App Store or through the Google Play Store. Outlook Desktop Client (Windows & Mac): The button can be found on the right side of the ribbon of the client. Within the message view window the button is in the same location: Outlook on the Web (OWA): You can find the button in Outlook on the Web in a couple of places depending on your settings. The place you can always look is in the "More Actions" section represented by the ... on the top right corner of the message.  The button is at the bottom with your other add-ins. Outlook on the Web on Mobile: It is recommended that you download the Outlook app instead of using OWA via a mobile browser, but if you are in a browser on mobile and visiting OWA the "Report Phish" link is directly between the header of the message and the message content.  Warning: Reporting via this method does not prompt you to confirm your submission. Click on the Settings Gear, and then type in "Surface" in the search box.  Click on "Message Surface" You can also go to the main outlook settings and find this section under Mail -> Customize actions. In the Message Surface section, find the check box for "Report Phish" that contains the appropriate icon, and select the checkbox.  Click Save at the top, then close out the windows to go back to outlook web app. Outlook Mobile Apps: In both Outlook for Android and Outlook for iOS the button can be found in the same manner.  When previewing a message, click on the 3 dots on the right side of the message, and then click on the "Report Phish" button: Outlook app for Android: Outlook app for iOS/Phone:
prompt: What does it look like and what clients are supported?, completion:  Where can I find the button in my client? After clicking the button you are prompted to confirm the report of the suspicious message.  Once confirmed, PhishAlarm will acknowledge your submission, and then send a copy of the email (including email header and content) to Proofpoint's Phish Alarm Analyzer and the Duke Security Offices for review and action.  Any message determined to be a phish will be removed from the your mailbox.  The system will also remove any copies of this message you have forwarded to others, and if the message was sent to a distribution list it will be removed from the mailbox of all members of the recipient group.  The dialog boxes displayed look as follows: Generally speaking the button will be found on the ribbon of the client.  See the screen captures below for information on your particular client.

Effective December 4, 2018 Duke began publishing an SPF record to inform receiving systems where Duke's email should originate from.  Duke's SPF record is crafted in a way that identifies mail sent from Duke networks (University or Health System), Exchange Online (office 365), or through Emma as authorized.  Any mail sent using an @duke.edu email address that is coming from a system outside of these networks would fall into a neutral category, characterized by a ?all SPF designation.   This neutral designation means that it is not confirmed this sender is allowed, but the sender is not strictly prohibited either. The way this record is implemented means that if you set up a third party to send mail from @duke.edu addresses you should not run into SPF issues on the receiving end. However; we will likely tighten down the SPF record in the future to limit sending of mail from @duke.edu addresses except from designated allowed senders. In general, we discourage the use of sending mail using @duke.edu as a sending address when using third parties that do not fit into our SPF record.  If you do use @duke.edu then please ensure that you consider bounces/undeliverable/replies.  In other words, please do not send from bogus email addresses. If you are going to use a third party to send emails we do encourage you to use a subdomain for this purpose.  The same guidance applies there regarding sending from bogus addresses.  If you are going to use a third level domain, aka subdomain, then OIT can assist you, if needed, with publishing a SPF record for that subdomain.  As with any SPF implementation the trick is understanding any/all mailers that send from the domain in use.

If you are traveling internationally, OIT recommends you complete these steps before leaving the U.S and considers these recommendations during your travels. Pack power charger and any adapters Make sure device chargers will work at your destination. Most chargers support 100-240 volts, which work in most countries but, you probably need a plug adapter to connect to wall ports at your destination, and may need a voltage adapter in some locales. Review power standards for your destination (IEC World Plugs reference) (link is external) Plan cell phone service Plan before you go to avoid losing service or incurring thousands of dollars in unplanned roaming charges. Using a US-based carrier like Verizon or AT&T: verify coverage and activate a global plan for discount voice/text/data. (Business managers can activate these for Duke-paid phones.) Activating local service at your destination: confirm your phone is unlocked and compatible with that country's carriers. More information on international cell phone use Set up eduroam The eduroam WiFi network is a secure, simple way to get online at universities, research sites and other locations worldwide. If you're traveling to a site that has eduroam (and thousands do), set up eduroam before you leave Duke and be automatically connected on arrival. Duke eduroam information Install VPN and enroll in MFA Use Duke's VPN to secure your online access to Duke files and access Library and other Duke resources.  Make sure VPN is installed and working on your devices before you go.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required to access the Duke Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Enroll in MFA prior to leaving so you are able to access VPN service. Duke VPN (portal.duke.edu) information and installers Prepare for data access Remove Duke sensitive or restricted data from devices before traveling.  Plan instead to use Duke Box or a departmental file server to securely access your files while traveling; Box Sync can also back up files from your laptop to the cloud, helpful if your device is lost or stolen. If your email account has sensitive Duke information, consider removing it from your device and use Office 365 webmail instead. Caution: If traveling with data/software that may be export-controlled contact export@duke.edu ASAP.  Duke Box may not be used for such items. Duke Box information Office 365 web access(link is external) Duke Export Controls guidelines(link is external) Update and secure devices Install any updates through Software Update (Mac), Windows Update (Windows), or Settings (iOS/Android) before your trip. Make sure anti-virus software, web browsers, and personal firewalls are installed, enabled and up to date. Duke's IT Security Office has more travel tips to secure web browsers and devices. For Duke-owned devices, let your departmental IT support know about your trip so they can check and update your device before you leave. Duke IT Security Office tips for tech security while traveling(link is external) Password protect and encrypt devices Configure all devices to require a strong password or passcode and automatically lock when idle to prevent unauthorized access. Laptop users should contact their local IT support for help with Duke's Whole Disk Encryption (WDE) solutions, such as FileVault 2 (Mac) and BitLocker (Windows). iPhones and iPads are encrypted when passcodes or Touch ID is enabled; Android users should enable encryption in their Security settings. Note: Local laws/regulations may restrict use of encryption; contact Duke Export Controls if you have questions. Always comply with local officals' requests to access your device. If you travel with an unencrypted device, we recommend it contain no Duke data. Laptops: Duke Whole Disk Encryption (WDE) information(link is external) Smartphones/tablets: Securing your iOS/Android device(link is external) Set up tracking in case devices are lost/stolen Electronic devices are major targets for theft when traveling.

Use trusted WiFi instead of cellular data when possible Even with a global plan/feature enabled or with using an in-country provider, cellular data is always more expensive than using a trusted WiFi network, like eduroam or a corporate/school network at your destination. Disable cellular data and data roaming on smartphones and tablets except when absolutely needed, since email, map and other apps are often using data even when you're not using the device. Close apps running in the background on devices when possible. Monitor cellular data use Track your cellular data use to avoid unexpected charges or running out of data allocation. Use the Cellular menu under Settings (iOS 8 only) or the Data Usage section under Settings (Android) to check your usage. Use a VoIP app for inexpensive calls Consider services like Skype or WebEx for inexpensive calling to colleagues and families back home. Avoid untrusted public WiFi or kiosks While WiFi is a handy way to stay connected, when you access the Internet from an unsecured network (including WiFi networks at airports, train stations and hotels), you run the risk of eavesdropping or attempts to steal account or credit card information. Use Duke's VPN on these networks to improve your security, and avoid them whenever possible. Avoid using public Internet kiosks or recharging stations. Erase/wipe device if lost or stolen If your device is lost/stolen overseas, use Android Device Manager, Find My iPhone, or Prey to lock and erase the device. Additionally, University Office 365 email users who enabled their @duke.edu email account on their smartphone/tablet can wipe their device through Office 365's web interface.

Urgent Care Clinic Track Board and Clinic Map The Urgent Care module allows users to use robust patient tracking tools to manage unpredictable patient volumes. New patient tracking tools are available for users logged into Urgent Care departments. Access to tracking tools such as the Clinic Track Board and Clinic Map, allow users to track the status of patients in their department and quickly view information about those patients. The Clinic Track Board provides a variety of views, each of which is set up to show a different subset of patients. For example, a user can choose to view all arrived patients or only their assigned patients. My Patients: This view will show patients assigned to you as the provider the patient was scheduled with or patients you have assigned yourself to as part of the visit treatment team In Clinic: This view will display patients after check in is complete Future: This view displays patients who have a visit scheduled in the clinic for that day but have not yet been checked into the Urgent Care department Completed: This view displays patients who have completed visits for the day. Patient visits are considered completed after chart completion or after the After Visit Summary (AVS) has been printed If the patient declines an AVS (MyChart patients may choose not to have their AVS printed), those patients can be moved to the completed view after chart completion or manually updating their status – From the Track Board or Map, right click on the patient, go to Patient Status, select Visit Complete The Clinic Map makes it easy for users to quickly locate patients, identify patients' statuses, and check which rooms are available.  From a view that mimics the physical layout of exam rooms and waiting areas in your facility, users can drag and drop to transfer patients between rooms. More than one patient can be placed in a room and a toggle will them become available within that room in order to move between patient charts.
prompt: When more than the displayable limit of patients are in the Waiting Room/Lobby, a toggle will be available there as well in order to see all patients in the waiting room., completion:  Toolbar buttons are available from both the Track Board and Clinic map to acknowledge orders, complete orders, reset orders to new and specify a treatment is in progress (Clinical Staff) and Review Orders (Providers): From both the Track Board and Map, users will see Icons populate for specific orders, such as Lab, EKG, Imaging, In Clinic Medications and Immunizations as well as a blue dot for any order placed within the encounter. The icons are removed when the orders are resulted or administered and the blue dot changes colors as the staff mark the order as acknowledged, completed and is removed when the provider marks the orders as reviewed. A color indicator will show the status of the patient as they move through the workflow.  Certain parts of your workflow update these statuses automatically and users are also able to manually make updates to the patient status. A Key is available in both the Track Board and Map toolbar to familiarize yourself with the color for each patient status. From both the Track Board and Map, clinicians can jump into a patient’s chart. Charting and ordering workflows remain the same for Urgent Care Departments.
