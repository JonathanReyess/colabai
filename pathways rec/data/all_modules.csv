15, Advanced CSS: Get to know Grid and Shape,"If you've done some CSS before, you know how much of a pain it is to place things just so... You've tried all the tricks, you've done all the math, and yet you can never get your layout exactly the way you were envisioning on paper... or you could but you had to try a million combinations or write what felt like a million lines of code. You are a wizard and CSS is magic... let Grid become your wand of supple wood with a phoenix core, and harness that power! Grid allows you to place things horizontally, vertically anywhere and everywhere, however you like, whenever you like. Want to move your footer in the middle of the page when your screen is between 800px and 1200px wide without using javascript ? You can! Want to have everything divided into 12 exact columns without worrying about margins and paddings and making mad calculations? You can! Want a grid within a grid within a grid? You can! This class is for made for the CSS enthusiast, or the downright frustrated CSS user who just would like to kill floats with fire. Intermediate understanding of CSS is expected to follow this class comfortably. If you do not know CSS, or haven't worked with it in a while, we suggest taking our Create a Website: Styling and Create a Website: Layout classes beforehand.
CSS Shapes is a more recent addition to the CSS family. This cluster of CSS rules will allow you to have greater control over the way text display next to an image. Come to this workshop to learn how to make it follow a curve or create new shapes to build dynamic compositions on the web. A good understanding of CSS is recommended for this class. If that does not sound like you, try and take Create a Website: Styling and Create a Website: Layouts before this one."

Indeed, your code base may be a bit different from that of the example you found and thus to make it work, you will need to adapt it for your needs. Repurposing, just like debugging, starts by understanding how the code works the way it does and why. In this workshop, we will go over a repurposing example as well as methodologies for debugging CSS. Prior basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is highly encouraged as we will not go over those."

According to The Herald, documenting the growth of music in Zimbabwe without mentioning Leonard Dembo would be incomplete. Dembo, who passed away on April 9, 1996, at the age of 37, was one of the greatest musicians to emerge from the country. His music addressed societal issues, including love, unity, and peace. Dembo is arguably the best musician to grace the Zimbabwean music scene.

They will also be provided with a translated version of the song and encouraged to create their own inspired written pieces. Students will then share their creations, and our guest poet will provide an interpretation of the song. This process aims to inspire students to discover poetry within music and all aspects of life, as a means to tap into the profound love that resides within us."
